 * The high score of nums is the maximum value of |nums[i] - nums[j]| over all 0 <= i < j < nums.length.

Explanation: Change nums[0] and nums[1] to be 6. Now nums becomes [6,6,7,8,5].
Our low score is achieved when i = 0 and j = 1, in which case |nums[i] - nums[j]| = |6 - 6| = 0.

Their concatenation is 512, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 512.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [14,13,8].
 - In the second operation:

Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements - You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Starting with score = 0, apply the following algorithm:

 * Choose the smallest integer of the array that is not marked. If there is a tie, choose the one with the smallest index.
 * Add the value of the chosen integer to score.
 * Mark the chosen element and its two adjacent elements if they exist.
 * Repeat until all the array elements are marked.

Return the score you get after applying the above algorithm.

 

Example 1:

Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its left adjacent element: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
- 4 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
Our score is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, since there are two of them, we choose the left-most one, so we mark the one at index 0 and its right adjacent element: [2,3,5,1,3,2].

The gifts are taken in the following way:
- In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
- Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
- After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
- Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.

Explanation: Initially, 5 is present on the board. 
The next day, 2 and 4 will be added since 5 % 2 == 1 and 5 % 4 == 1. 
After that day, 3 will be added to the board because 4 % 3 == 1. 
At the end of a billion days, the distinct numbers on the board will be 2, 3, 4, and 5. 


Example 2:


Input: n = 3

Rearrange Array to Maximize Prefix Score - You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. You can rearrange the elements of nums to any order (including the given order).

Let prefix be the array containing the prefix sums of nums after rearranging it. In other words, prefix[i] is the sum of the elements from 0 to i in nums after rearranging it. The score of nums is the number of positive integers in the array prefix.

Return the maximum score you can achieve.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,-1,0,1,-3,3,-3]
Output: 6
Explanation: We can rearrange the array into nums = [2,3,1,-1,-3,0,-3].
prefix = [2,5,6,5,2,2,-1], so the score is 6.
It can be shown that 6 is the maximum score we can obtain.

The tree is represented as a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several guesses about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

 * Chooses two distinct integers u and v such that there exists an edge [u, v] in the tree.
 * He tells Alice that u is the parent of v in the tree.

Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array guesses where guesses[j] = [uj, vj] indicates Bob guessed uj to be the parent of vj.

Alice being lazy, does not reply to each of Bob's guesses, but just says that at least k of his guesses are true.

Given the 2D integer arrays edges, guesses and the integer k, return the number of possible nodes that can be the root of Alice's tree. If there is no such tree, return 0.

 * Each range belongs to exactly one group.
 * Any two overlapping ranges must belong to the same group.

Two ranges are said to be overlapping if there exists at least one integer that is present in both ranges.

Example 1:

A split at an index i where 0 <= i <= n - 2 is called valid if the product of the first i + 1 elements and the product of the remaining elements are coprime.

 * For example, if nums = [2, 3, 3], then a split at the index i = 0 is valid because 2 and 9 are coprime, while a split at the index i = 1 is not valid because 6 and 3 are not coprime. A split at the index i = 2 is not valid because i == n - 1.

Return the smallest index i at which the array can be split validly or -1 if there is no such split.

Time to Cross a Bridge - There are k workers who want to move n boxes from an old warehouse to a new one. You are given the two integers n and k, and a 2D integer array time of size k x 4 where time[i] = [leftToRighti, pickOldi, rightToLefti, putNewi].

The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. The old warehouse is on the right bank of the river, and the new warehouse is on the left bank of the river. Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the ith worker (0-indexed) can :

 * Cross the bridge from the left bank (new warehouse) to the right bank (old warehouse) in leftToRighti minutes.
 * Pick a box from the old warehouse and return to the bridge in pickOldi minutes. Different workers can pick up their boxes simultaneously.
 * Cross the bridge from the right bank (old warehouse) to the left bank (new warehouse) in rightToLefti minutes.
 * Put the box in the new warehouse and return to the bridge in putNewi minutes. Different workers can put their boxes simultaneously.

A worker i is less efficient than a worker j if either condition is met:

 * leftToRighti + rightToLefti > leftToRightj + rightToLeftj
 * leftToRighti + rightToLefti == leftToRightj + rightToLeftj and i > j

The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge :

 * If a worker x reaches the bridge while another worker y is crossing the bridge, x waits at their side of the bridge.
 * If the bridge is free, the worker waiting on the right side of the bridge gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the right side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.
 * If the bridge is free and no worker is waiting on the right side, and at least one box remains at the old warehouse, the worker on the left side of the river gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the left side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.

Return the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left bank of the river after all n boxes have been put in the new warehouse.

Input: n = 1, k = 3, time = [[1,1,2,1],[1,1,3,1],[1,1,4,1]]

From 1 to 2: worker 2 picks up a box from the old warehouse.
From 2 to 6: worker 2 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left bank.
From 6 to 7: worker 2 puts a box at the new warehouse.

From 10 to 11: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the left bank to the right bank.
From 11 to 20: worker 0 picks up a box from the old warehouse.
From 20 to 30: worker 1 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left bank.
From 30 to 40: worker 1 puts a box at the new warehouse.
From 30 to 31: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left bank.
From 31 to 39: worker 0 puts a box at the new warehouse.

Maximum Subsequence Score - You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and a positive integer k. You must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.

For chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:

 * The sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
 * It can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).

Return the maximum possible score.

A subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The four possible subsequence scores are:
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
- We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12. 
- We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) * min(1,3,4) = 8.

Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]], price = [9,8,7,6,10,5]
Output: 24
Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 2. The first part (colored in red) shows the path with the maximum price sum. The second part (colored in blue) shows the path with the minimum price sum.
- The first path contains nodes [2,1,3,4]: the prices are [7,8,6,10], and the sum of the prices is 31.
- The second path contains the node [2] with the price [7].
The difference between the maximum and minimum price sum is 24. It can be proved that 24 is the maximum cost.

Maximize the Minimum Powered City - You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.

 * Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.

The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.

The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.

Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.

Example 1:


Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2

Explanation: 
One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.

Maximum Enemy Forts That Can Be Captured - You are given a 0-indexed integer array forts of length n representing the positions of several forts. forts[i] can be -1, 0, or 1 where:

 * -1 represents there is no fort at the ith position.
 * 0 indicates there is an enemy fort at the ith position.
 * 1 indicates the fort at the ith the position is under your command.

Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position i to an empty position j such that:

 * 0 <= i, j <= n - 1
 * The army travels over enemy forts only. Formally, for all k where min(i,j) < k < max(i,j), forts[k] == 0.

While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are captured.

Return the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured. In case it is impossible to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your command, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Explanation:
- Moving the army from position 0 to position 3 captures 2 enemy forts, at 1 and 2.
- Moving the army from position 8 to position 3 captures 4 enemy forts.
Since 4 is the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured, we return 4.

Minimum Total Cost to Make Arrays Unequal - You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, of equal length n.

In one operation, you can swap the values of any two indices of nums1. The cost of this operation is the sum of the indices.

Find the minimum total cost of performing the given operation any number of times such that nums1[i] != nums2[i] for all 0 <= i <= n - 1 after performing all the operations.

Return the minimum total cost such that nums1 and nums2 satisfy the above condition. In case it is not possible, return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 0 and 3, incurring cost = 0 + 3 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,2,3,1,5]
- Swap values at indices 1 and 2, incurring cost = 1 + 2 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,3,2,1,5].
- Swap values at indices 0 and 4, incurring cost = 0 + 4 = 4. Now, nums1 =[5,3,2,1,4].
We can see that for each index i, nums1[i] != nums2[i]. The cost required here is 10.
Note that there are other ways to swap values, but it can be proven that it is not possible to obtain a cost less than 10.


Example 2:


Input: nums1 = [2,2,2,1,3], nums2 = [1,2,2,3,3]

One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 2 and 3, incurring cost = 2 + 3 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,2,1,2,3].
- Swap values at indices 1 and 4, incurring cost = 1 + 4 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,3,1,2,2].
The total cost needed here is 10, which is the minimum possible.

Minimum Penalty for a Shop - You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':

 * if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
 * whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.

If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:

 * For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
 * For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.

Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.

Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.

 

Example 1:


Input: customers = ""YYNY""
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 3rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 4th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
Closing the shop at 2nd or 4th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.

Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.

Count Ways To Build Good Strings - Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

 * Append the character '0' zero times.
 * Append the character '1' one times.

This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: low = 3, high = 3, zero = 1, one = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: 
One possible valid good string is ""011"". 
It can be constructed as follows: """" -> ""0"" -> ""01"" -> ""011"". 
All binary strings from ""000"" to ""111"" are good strings in this example.

As long as nums is not empty, you must repetitively:

 * Find the minimum number in nums and remove it.
 * Find the maximum number in nums and remove it.
 * Calculate the average of the two removed numbers.

The average of two numbers a and b is (a + b) / 2.

Example 1:


Input: nums = [4,1,4,0,3,5]

Explanation:
1. Remove 0 and 5, and the average is (0 + 5) / 2 = 2.5. Now, nums = [4,1,4,3].
2. Remove 1 and 4. The average is (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5, and nums = [4,3].
3. Remove 3 and 4, and the average is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5.

The positions of each robot are unique. The positions of each factory are also unique. Note that a robot can be in the same position as a factory initially.

All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.

You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:

 * You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
 * In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
   * For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
   * In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
 * If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.

- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.
- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.
- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.
The total hiring cost is 11.

- i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].
- i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].

Explanation:
- Changing the 'r' in ""word"" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word ""wood"".
- Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in ""note"" changes it to ""joke"".
- It would take more than 2 edits for ""ants"" to equal a dictionary word.

Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries - You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.

You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:

 * Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.

Note:

 * The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
 * The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-2.png]


Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
Output: [3,2,3,2]
Explanation: We have the following queries:
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).

 * Delete the entire string s, or
 * Delete the first i letters of s if the first i letters of s are equal to the following i letters in s, for any i in the range 1 <= i <= s.length / 2.

For example, if s = ""ababc"", then in one operation, you could delete the first two letters of s to get ""abc"", since the first two letters of s and the following two letters of s are both equal to ""ab"".

- Delete the first 3 letters (""abc"") since the next 3 letters are equal. Now, s = ""abcdabc"".
- Delete all the letters.
We used 2 operations so return 2. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of operations needed.
Note that in the second operation we cannot delete ""abc"" again because the next occurrence of ""abc"" does not happen in the next 3 letters.


Example 2:

- Delete the first letter (""a"") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = ""aabaab"".

Smallest Subarrays With Maximum Bitwise OR - You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n, consisting of non-negative integers. For each index i from 0 to n - 1, you must determine the size of the minimum sized non-empty subarray of nums starting at i (inclusive) that has the maximum possible bitwise OR.

 * In other words, let Bij be the bitwise OR of the subarray nums[i...j]. You need to find the smallest subarray starting at i, such that bitwise OR of this subarray is equal to max(Bik) where i <= k <= n - 1.

The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.

Return an integer array answer of size n where answer[i] is the length of the minimum sized subarray starting at i with maximum bitwise OR.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,0,2,1,3]
Output: [3,3,2,2,1]
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise OR starting at any index is 3. 
- Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields it is [1,0,2].
- Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [0,2,1].
- Starting at index 2, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [2,1].
- Starting at index 3, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [1,3].
- Starting at index 4, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [3].
Therefore, we return [3,3,2,2,1].

Maximum Rows Covered by Columns - You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix matrix and an integer numSelect, which denotes the number of distinct columns you must select from matrix.

Let us consider s = {c1, c2, ...., cnumSelect} as the set of columns selected by you. A row row is covered by s if:

 * For each cell matrix[row][col] (0 <= col <= n - 1) where matrix[row][col] == 1, col is present in s or,
 * No cell in row has a value of 1.

You need to choose numSelect columns such that the number of rows that are covered is maximized.

Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered by a set of numSelect columns.

Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
We choose s = {0, 2}.
- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
- Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
- Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s.
Thus, we can cover three rows.
Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered.

Check Distances Between Same Letters - You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in s appears exactly twice. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array distance of length 26.

Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from 0 to 25 (i.e. 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, 'c' -> 2, ... , 'z' -> 25).

In a well-spaced string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the ith letter is distance[i]. If the ith letter does not appear in s, then distance[i] can be ignored.

Return true if s is a well-spaced string, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""abaccb"", distance = [1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance[0] = 1.
- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance[1] = 3.
- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance[2] = 0.
Note that distance[3] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.
Return true because s is a well-spaced string.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""aa"", distance = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: false
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.
Because distance[0] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.

- (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.

 * a 2D integer array colConditions of size m where colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti].

The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.

You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.

The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

 * The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.
 * The number lefti should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number righti appears for all i from 0 to m - 1.

Return any matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.

Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
The row conditions are the following:
- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
The column conditions are the following:
- Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
Note that there may be multiple correct answers.


Example 2:


Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]

No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.

Picking up one unit of any type of garbage takes 1 minute.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array travel where travel[i] is the number of minutes needed to go from house i to house i + 1.

There are three garbage trucks in the city, each responsible for picking up one type of garbage. Each garbage truck starts at house 0 and must visit each house in order; however, they do not need to visit every house.

Only one garbage truck may be used at any given moment. While one truck is driving or picking up garbage, the other two trucks cannot do anything.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [4,5,2,1], queries = [3,10,21]
Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: We answer the queries as follows:
- The subsequence [2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 3. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[0] = 2.
- The subsequence [4,5,1] has a sum less than or equal to 10. It can be proven that 3 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[1] = 3.
- The subsequence [4,5,2,1] has a sum less than or equal to 21. It can be proven that 4 is the maximum size of such a subsequence, so answer[2] = 4.

Maximum Segment Sum After Removals - You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and removeQueries, both of length n. For the ith query, the element in nums at the index removeQueries[i] is removed, splitting nums into different segments.

A segment is a contiguous sequence of positive integers in nums. A segment sum is the sum of every element in a segment.

Return an integer array answer, of length n, where answer[i] is the maximum segment sum after applying the ith removal.

Note: The same index will not be removed more than once.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
Output: [14,7,2,2,0]
Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
Query 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,2,5,6,1] and the maximum segment sum is 14 for segment [2,5,6,1].
Query 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [0,2,5,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 7 for segment [2,5].
Query 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.

Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition - You are entering a competition, and are given two positive integers initialEnergy and initialExperience denoting your initial energy and initial experience respectively.

You are also given two 0-indexed integer arrays energy and experience, both of length n.

You will face n opponents in order. The energy and experience of the ith opponent is denoted by energy[i] and experience[i] respectively. When you face an opponent, you need to have both strictly greater experience and energy to defeat them and move to the next opponent if available.

Defeating the ith opponent increases your experience by experience[i], but decreases your energy by energy[i].

Before starting the competition, you can train for some number of hours. After each hour of training, you can either choose to increase your initial experience by one, or increase your initial energy by one.

Return the minimum number of training hours required to defeat all n opponents.

 

Example 1:


Input: initialEnergy = 5, initialExperience = 3, energy = [1,4,3,2], experience = [2,6,3,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can increase your energy to 11 after 6 hours of training, and your experience to 5 after 2 hours of training.
You face the opponents in the following order:
- You have more energy and experience than the 0th opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 11 - 1 = 10, and your experience becomes 5 + 2 = 7.
- You have more energy and experience than the 1st opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 10 - 4 = 6, and your experience becomes 7 + 6 = 13.
- You have more energy and experience than the 2nd opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 6 - 3 = 3, and your experience becomes 13 + 3 = 16.
- You have more energy and experience than the 3rd opponent so you win.
  Your energy becomes 3 - 2 = 1, and your experience becomes 16 + 1 = 17.
You did a total of 6 + 2 = 8 hours of training before the competition, so we return 8.

Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition - You are given a positive integer array grades which represents the grades of students in a university. You would like to enter all these students into a competition in ordered non-empty groups, such that the ordering meets the following conditions:

 * The sum of the grades of students in the ith group is less than the sum of the grades of students in the (i + 1)th group, for all groups (except the last).
 * The total number of students in the ith group is less than the total number of students in the (i + 1)th group, for all groups (except the last).

Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed.

 

Example 1:


Input: grades = [10,6,12,7,3,5]

Explanation: The following is a possible way to form 3 groups of students:
- 1st group has the students with grades = [12]. Sum of grades: 12. Student count: 1
- 2nd group has the students with grades = [6,7]. Sum of grades: 6 + 7 = 13. Student count: 2
- 3rd group has the students with grades = [10,3,5]. Sum of grades: 10 + 3 + 5 = 18. Student count: 3
It can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.

Move Pieces to Obtain a String - You are given two strings start and target, both of length n. Each string consists only of the characters 'L', 'R', and '_' where:

 * The characters 'L' and 'R' represent pieces, where a piece 'L' can move to the left only if there is a blank space directly to its left, and a piece 'R' can move to the right only if there is a blank space directly to its right.
 * The character '_' represents a blank space that can be occupied by any of the 'L' or 'R' pieces.

Return true if it is possible to obtain the string target by moving the pieces of the string start any number of times. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:


Input: start = ""_L__R__R_"", target = ""L______RR""
Output: true
Explanation: We can obtain the string target from start by doing the following moves:
- Move the first piece one step to the left, start becomes equal to ""L___R__R_"".
- Move the last piece one step to the right, start becomes equal to ""L___R___R"".
- Move the second piece three steps to the right, start becomes equal to ""L______RR"".
Since it is possible to get the string target from start, we return true.


Example 2:


Input: start = ""R_L_"", target = ""__LR""
Output: false
Explanation: The 'R' piece in the string start can move one step to the right to obtain ""_RL_"".
After that, no pieces can move anymore, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

Decode the Message - You are given the strings key and message, which represent a cipher key and a secret message, respectively. The steps to decode message are as follows:

 1. Use the first appearance of all 26 lowercase English letters in key as the order of the substitution table.
 2. Align the substitution table with the regular English alphabet.
 3. Each letter in message is then substituted using the table.
 4. Spaces ' ' are transformed to themselves.

 * For example, given key = ""happy boy"" (actual key would have at least one instance of each letter in the alphabet), we have the partial substitution table of ('h' -> 'a', 'a' -> 'b', 'p' -> 'c', 'y' -> 'd', 'b' -> 'e', 'o' -> 'f').

Number of Distinct Roll Sequences - You are given an integer n. You roll a fair 6-sided dice n times. Determine the total number of distinct sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied:

 1. The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to 1.
 2. There is at least a gap of 2 rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the ith roll is equal to the value of the jth roll, then abs(i - j) > 2.

Return the total number of distinct sequences possible. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different.

 

Example 1:

Output: 184
Explanation: Some of the possible sequences are (1, 2, 3, 4), (6, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3, 1), etc.
Some invalid sequences are (1, 2, 1, 3), (1, 2, 3, 6).
(1, 2, 1, 3) is invalid since the first and third roll have an equal value and abs(1 - 3) = 2 (i and j are 1-indexed).
(1, 2, 3, 6) is invalid since the greatest common divisor of 3 and 6 = 3.
There are a total of 184 distinct sequences possible, so we return 184.

 * Add text to where the cursor is.
 * Delete text from where the cursor is (simulating the backspace key).
 * Move the cursor either left or right.

When deleting text, only characters to the left of the cursor will be deleted. The cursor will also remain within the actual text and cannot be moved beyond it. More formally, we have that 0 <= cursor.position <= currentText.length always holds.

Implement the TextEditor class:

 * TextEditor() Initializes the object with empty text.
 * void addText(string text) Appends text to where the cursor is. The cursor ends to the right of text.
 * int deleteText(int k) Deletes k characters to the left of the cursor. Returns the number of characters actually deleted.
 * string cursorLeft(int k) Moves the cursor to the left k times. Returns the last min(10, len) characters to the left of the cursor, where len is the number of characters to the left of the cursor.
 * string cursorRight(int k) Moves the cursor to the right k times. Returns the last min(10, len) characters to the left of the cursor, where len is the number of characters to the left of the cursor.

Maximum Total Importance of Roads - You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.

Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path - You are given a 2D integer array grid of size m x n, where each cell contains a positive integer.

A cornered path is defined as a set of adjacent cells with at most one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either horizontally or vertically up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the alternate direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.

A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:

 1. Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
 2. Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, ""346"" is replaced with ""13"" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
 3. Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.

Return s after all rounds have been completed.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""11111222223"", k = 3
Output: ""135""
Explanation: 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: ""111"", ""112"", ""222"", and ""23"".
  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
  So, s becomes ""3"" + ""4"" + ""6"" + ""5"" = ""3465"" after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into ""346"" and ""5"".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
  So, s becomes ""13"" + ""5"" = ""135"" after second round. 
Now, s.length <= k, so we return ""135"" as the answer.

Input: s = ""00000000"", k = 3

Explanation: 
We divide s into ""000"", ""000"", and ""00"".
Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. 
s becomes ""0"" + ""0"" + ""0"" = ""000"", whose length is equal to k, so we return ""000"".

Substring With Largest Variance - The variance of a string is defined as the largest difference between the number of occurrences of any 2 characters present in the string. Note the two characters may or may not be the same.

Given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters only, return the largest variance possible among all substrings of s.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""aababbb""
Output: 3
Explanation:
All possible variances along with their respective substrings are listed below:
- Variance 0 for substrings ""a"", ""aa"", ""ab"", ""abab"", ""aababb"", ""ba"", ""b"", ""bb"", and ""bbb"".
- Variance 1 for substrings ""aab"", ""aba"", ""abb"", ""aabab"", ""ababb"", ""aababbb"", and ""bab"".
- Variance 2 for substrings ""aaba"", ""ababbb"", ""abbb"", and ""babb"".
- Variance 3 for substring ""babbb"".
Since the largest possible variance is 3, we return it.

Return the number of valid splits in nums.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [10,4,-8,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.

Explanation: 
There are two valid splits in nums:

Explanation: The price of a pen is 10 and the price of a pencil is 5.
- If you buy 0 pens, you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pencils.
- If you buy 1 pen, you can buy 0, 1, or 2 pencils.
- If you buy 2 pens, you cannot buy any pencils.

 * It can be written as (A), where A is a valid parentheses string.

You are given an m x n matrix of parentheses grid. A valid parentheses string path in the grid is a path satisfying all of the following conditions:

 * The path starts from the upper left cell (0, 0).
 * The path ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1).

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/15/1200px-telephone-keypad2svg.png]

In order to add a letter, Alice has to press the key of the corresponding digit i times, where i is the position of the letter in the key.

 * For example, to add the letter 's', Alice has to press '7' four times. Similarly, to add the letter 'k', Alice has to press '5' twice.
 * Note that the digits '0' and '1' do not map to any letters, so Alice does not use them.

However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a string of pressed keys instead.

 * For example, when Alice sent the message ""bob"", Bob received the string ""2266622"".

Given a string pressedKeys representing the string received by Bob, return the total number of possible text messages Alice could have sent.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Explanation:
The possible text messages Alice could have sent are:
""aaadd"", ""abdd"", ""badd"", ""cdd"", ""aaae"", ""abe"", ""bae"", and ""ce"".
Since there are 8 possible messages, we return 8.

Note that even if the fire spreads to the safehouse immediately after you have reached it, it will be counted as safely reaching the safehouse.

A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/ex1new.jpg]


Input: grid = [[0,2,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2,2,1,0],[0,2,0,0,1,2,0],[0,0,2,2,2,0,2],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above shows the scenario where you stay in the initial position for 3 minutes.
You will still be able to safely reach the safehouse.
Staying for more than 3 minutes will not allow you to safely reach the safehouse.

Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/ex2new2.jpg]


Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,0],[0,2,0,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The figure above shows the scenario where you immediately move towards the safehouse.
Fire will spread to any cell you move towards and it is impossible to safely reach the safehouse.
Thus, -1 is returned.


Example 3:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/03/10/ex3new.jpg]


Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[2,2,0],[1,2,0]]
Output: 1000000000
Explanation: The figure above shows the initial grid.
Notice that the fire is contained by walls and you will always be able to safely reach the safehouse.
Thus, 109 is returned.

Explanation:
- The average difference of index 0 is: |2 / 1 - (5 + 3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 5| = |2 / 1 - 25 / 5| = |2 - 5| = 3.
- The average difference of index 1 is: |(2 + 5) / 2 - (3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 4| = |7 / 2 - 20 / 4| = |3 - 5| = 2.
- The average difference of index 2 is: |(2 + 5 + 3) / 3 - (9 + 5 + 3) / 3| = |10 / 3 - 17 / 3| = |3 - 5| = 2.
- The average difference of index 3 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9) / 4 - (5 + 3) / 2| = |19 / 4 - 8 / 2| = |4 - 4| = 0.
- The average difference of index 4 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 5) / 5 - 3 / 1| = |24 / 5 - 3 / 1| = |4 - 3| = 1.
- The average difference of index 5 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 6 - 0| = |27 / 6 - 0| = |4 - 0| = 4.

Example 1:


Input: number = ""123"", digit = ""3""
Output: ""12""
Explanation: There is only one '3' in ""123"". After removing '3', the result is ""12"".


Example 2:


Input: number = ""1231"", digit = ""1""
Output: ""231""
Explanation: We can remove the first '1' to get ""231"" or remove the second '1' to get ""123"".
Since 231 > 123, we return ""231"".


Example 3:


Input: number = ""551"", digit = ""5""
Output: ""51""
Explanation: We can remove either the first or second '5' from ""551"".
Both result in the string ""51"".

You are then given another integer newFlowers, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers target, full, and partial.

A garden is considered complete if it has at least target flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:

 * The number of complete gardens multiplied by full.
 * The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by partial. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be 0.

Return the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most newFlowers flowers.

Explanation:
For s1 == ""b"", the longest common prefix is ""b"" which has a score of 1.
For s2 == ""ab"", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s3 == ""bab"", the longest common prefix is ""bab"" which has a score of 3.
For s4 == ""abab"", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s5 == ""babab"", the longest common prefix is ""babab"" which has a score of 5.

Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.

Maximum Points in an Archery Competition - Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:

 1. Alice first shoots numArrows arrows and then Bob shoots numArrows arrows.
 2. The points are then calculated as follows:
    1. The target has integer scoring sections ranging from 0 to 11 inclusive.
    2. For each section of the target with score k (in between 0 to 11), say Alice and Bob have shot ak and bk arrows on that section respectively. If ak >= bk, then Alice takes k points. If ak < bk, then Bob takes k points.
    3. However, if ak == bk == 0, then nobody takes k points.

 * For example, if Alice and Bob both shot 2 arrows on the section with score 11, then Alice takes 11 points. On the other hand, if Alice shot 0 arrows on the section with score 11 and Bob shot 2 arrows on that same section, then Bob takes 11 points.

You are given the integer numArrows and an integer array aliceArrows of size 12, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. Now, Bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain.

Return the array bobArrows which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. The sum of the values in bobArrows should equal numArrows.

Count Collisions on a Road - There are n cars on an infinitely long road. The cars are numbered from 0 to n - 1 from left to right and each car is present at a unique point.

You are given a 0-indexed string directions of length n. directions[i] can be either 'L', 'R', or 'S' denoting whether the ith car is moving towards the left, towards the right, or staying at its current point respectively. Each moving car has the same speed.

The number of collisions can be calculated as follows:

 * When two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by 2.
 * When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by 1.

After a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.

Return the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.

 

Example 1:


Input: directions = ""RLRSLL""
Output: 5
Explanation:
The collisions that will happen on the road are:
- Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.
- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.
- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.
Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5.

You can add either pattern[0] or pattern[1] anywhere in text exactly once. Note that the character can be added even at the beginning or at the end of text.

Return the maximum number of times pattern can occur as a subsequence of the modified text.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

 

Example 1:


Input: text = ""abdcdbc"", pattern = ""ac""
Output: 4
Explanation:
If we add pattern[0] = 'a' in between text[1] and text[2], we get ""abadcdbc"". Now, the number of times ""ac"" occurs as a subsequence is 4.
Some other strings which have 4 subsequences ""ac"" after adding a character to text are ""aabdcdbc"" and ""abdacdbc"".
However, strings such as ""abdcadbc"", ""abdccdbc"", and ""abdcdbcc"", although obtainable, have only 3 subsequences ""ac"" and are thus suboptimal.
It can be shown that it is not possible to get more than 4 subsequences ""ac"" by adding only one character.


Example 2:


Input: text = ""aabb"", pattern = ""ab""
Output: 6
Explanation:
Some of the strings which can be obtained from text and have 6 subsequences ""ab"" are ""aaabb"", ""aaabb"", and ""aabbb"".

Explanation:
- At time t = 1, the number of trips completed by each bus are [1,0,0]. 
  The total number of trips completed is 1 + 0 + 0 = 1.
- At time t = 2, the number of trips completed by each bus are [2,1,0].

- Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.

Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods - You are given a 0-indexed binary string s which represents a sequence of train cars. s[i] = '0' denotes that the ith car does not contain illegal goods and s[i] = '1' denotes that the ith car does contain illegal goods.

As the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods. You can do any of the following three operations any number of times:

 1. Remove a train car from the left end (i.e., remove s[0]) which takes 1 unit of time.
 2. Remove a train car from the right end (i.e., remove s[s.length - 1]) which takes 1 unit of time.
 3. Remove a train car from anywhere in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.

Return the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.

Note that an empty sequence of cars is considered to have no cars containing illegal goods.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""1100101""
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end. Time taken is 1.
- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.
This obtains a total time of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. 

An alternative way is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end 3 times. Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
This also obtains a total time of 2 + 3 = 5.

5 is the minimum time taken to remove all the cars containing illegal goods. 
There are no other ways to remove them with less time.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""0010""
Output: 2
Explanation:
One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove a car from the left end 3 times. Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
This obtains a total time of 3.

Another way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.
This obtains a total time of 2.

Another way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to 
- remove a car from the right end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2. 
This obtains a total time of 2.

2 is the minimum time taken to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.

 1. Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.
    * For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.
 2. Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:


Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3,4,1]
Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].

Groups of Strings - You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of words.

Two strings s1 and s2 are said to be connected if the set of letters of s2 can be obtained from the set of letters of s1 by any one of the following operations:

 * Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of s1.
 * Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of s1.
 * Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of s1 with any letter, including itself.

The array words can be divided into one or more non-intersecting groups. A string belongs to a group if any one of the following is true:

 * It is connected to at least one other string of the group.
 * It is the only string present in the group.

Note that the strings in words should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.

Return an array ans of size 2 where:

 * ans[0] is the maximum number of groups words can be divided into, and
 * ans[1] is the size of the largest group.

 

Example 1:


Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""ab"",""cde""]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
- words[0] can be used to obtain words[1] (by replacing 'a' with 'b'), and words[2] (by adding 'b'). So words[0] is connected to words[1] and words[2].
- words[1] can be used to obtain words[0] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words[2] (by adding 'a'). So words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].
- words[2] can be used to obtain words[0] (by deleting 'b'), and words[1] (by deleting 'a'). So words[2] is connected to words[0] and words[1].
- words[3] is not connected to any string in words.
Thus, words can be divided into 2 groups [""a"",""b"",""ab""] and [""cde""]. The size of the largest group is 3.  


Example 2:


Input: words = [""a"",""ab"",""abc""]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation:
- words[0] is connected to words[1].
- words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].
- words[2] is connected to words[1].
Since all strings are connected to each other, they should be grouped together.
Thus, the size of the largest group is 3.

Find Substring With Given Hash Value - The hash of a 0-indexed string s of length k, given integers p and m, is computed using the following function:

 * hash(s, p, m) = (val(s[0]) * p0 + val(s[1]) * p1 + ... + val(s[k-1]) * pk-1) mod m.

Where val(s[i]) represents the index of s[i] in the alphabet from val('a') = 1 to val('z') = 26.

You are given a string s and the integers power, modulo, k, and hashValue. Return sub, the first substring of s of length k such that hash(sub, power, modulo) == hashValue.

Explanation: Each person makes a single statement.
- Person 0 states that person 1 is good.
- Person 1 states that person 0 is good.
- Person 2 states that person 1 is bad.
Let's take person 2 as the key.
- Assuming that person 2 is a good person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, person 1 is a bad person.
    - Now we know for sure that person 1 is bad and person 2 is good.
    - Based on the statement made by person 1, and since person 1 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. There will be a contradiction in this case and this assumption is invalid.
        - lying. In this case, person 0 is also a bad person and lied in their statement.
    - Following that person 2 is a good person, there will be only one good person in the group.
- Assuming that person 2 is a bad person:
    - Based on the statement made by person 2, and since person 2 is bad, they could be:
        - telling the truth. Following this scenario, person 0 and 1 are both bad as explained before.
            - Following that person 2 is bad but told the truth, there will be no good persons in the group.
        - lying. In this case person 1 is a good person.
            - Since person 1 is a good person, person 0 is also a good person.
            - Following that person 2 is bad and lied, there will be two good persons in the group.
We can see that at most 2 persons are good in the best case, so we return 2.

- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 


Example 2:


Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.

 * at least 1 second.
 * at most 99 minutes and 99 seconds.

To set the cooking time, you push at most four digits. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes. It interprets the first two digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. It then adds them up as the cooking time. For example,

 * You push 9 5 4 (three digits). It is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 54 seconds.
 * You push 0 0 0 8 (four digits). It is interpreted as 0 minutes and 8 seconds.
 * You push 8 0 9 0. It is interpreted as 80 minutes and 90 seconds.
 * You push 8 1 3 0. It is interpreted as 81 minutes and 30 seconds.

You are given integers startAt, moveCost, pushCost, and targetSeconds. Initially, your finger is on the digit startAt. Moving the finger above any specific digit costs moveCost units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger once costs pushCost units of fatigue.

There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for targetSeconds seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.

Return the minimum cost to set targetSeconds seconds of cooking time.

Remember that one minute consists of 60 seconds.

Input: startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time.
- 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds.
  The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost.
- 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds.
  The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.
- 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds.
  The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/30/2.png]


Input: startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76 seconds.
The finger moves to 7 (with cost 1), pushes 7 (with cost 2), moves to 6 (with cost 1), and pushes 6 (with cost 2). The total cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6
Note other possible ways are 0076, 076, 0116, and 116, but none of them produces the minimum cost.

Divide a String Into Groups of Size k - A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:

 * The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
 * For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.

Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.

Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""abcdefghi"", k = 3, fill = ""x""
Output: [""abc"",""def"",""ghi""]
Explanation:
The first 3 characters ""abc"" form the first group.
The next 3 characters ""def"" form the second group.
The last 3 characters ""ghi"" form the third group.
Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.
Thus, the groups formed are ""abc"", ""def"", and ""ghi"".


Example 2:


Input: s = ""abcdefghij"", k = 3, fill = ""x""
Output: [""abc"",""def"",""ghi"",""jxx""]
Explanation:
Similar to the previous example, we are forming the first three groups ""abc"", ""def"", and ""ghi"".
For the last group, we can only use the character 'j' from the string. To complete this group, we add 'x' twice.
Thus, the 4 groups formed are ""abc"", ""def"", ""ghi"", and ""jxx"".

Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom - You have n flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays plantTime and growTime, of length n each:

 * plantTime[i] is the number of full days it takes you to plant the ith seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on planting it in total.

Count Words Obtained After Adding a Letter - You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings startWords and targetWords. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.

For each string in targetWords, check if it is possible to choose a string from startWords and perform a conversion operation on it to be equal to that from targetWords.

The conversion operation is described in the following two steps:

 1. Append any lowercase letter that is not present in the string to its end.
    * For example, if the string is ""abc"", the letters 'd', 'e', or 'y' can be added to it, but not 'a'. If 'd' is added, the resulting string will be ""abcd"".
 2. Rearrange the letters of the new string in any arbitrary order.
    * For example, ""abcd"" can be rearranged to ""acbd"", ""bacd"", ""cbda"", and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to ""abcd"" itself.

Return the number of strings in targetWords that can be obtained by performing the operations on any string of startWords.

Note that you will only be verifying if the string in targetWords can be obtained from a string in startWords by performing the operations. The strings in startWords do not actually change during this process.

 

Example 1:


Input: startWords = [""ant"",""act"",""tack""], targetWords = [""tack"",""act"",""acti""]

Explanation:
- In order to form targetWords[0] = ""tack"", we use startWords[1] = ""act"", append 'k' to it, and rearrange ""actk"" to ""tack"".
- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords[1] = ""act"".
  Note that ""act"" does exist in startWords, but we must append one letter to the string before rearranging it.
- In order to form targetWords[2] = ""acti"", we use startWords[1] = ""act"", append 'i' to it, and rearrange ""acti"" to ""acti"" itself.


Example 2:


Input: startWords = [""ab"",""a""], targetWords = [""abc"",""abcd""]

K Highest Ranked Items Within a Price Range - You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n that represents a map of the items in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following:

 * 0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
 * 1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
 * All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.

It takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells.

You are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low, high] and start = [row, col] indicates that you start at the position (row, col) and are interested only in items with a price in the range of [low, high] (inclusive). You are further given an integer k.

You are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different:

 1. Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter distance has a higher rank).
 2. Price (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).
 3. The row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).
 4. The column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).

Return the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to lowest). If there are fewer than k reachable items within the price range, return all of them.

Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).
The ranks of these items are:
- (0,1) with distance 1
- (1,1) with distance 2

Input: grid = [[1,2,0,1],[1,3,3,1],[0,2,5,1]], pricing = [2,3], start = [2,3], k = 2
Output: [[2,1],[1,2]]
Explanation: You start at (2,3).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) and (2,1).
The ranks of these items are:
- (2,1) with distance 2, price 2
- (1,2) with distance 2, price 3
- (1,1) with distance 3
- (0,1) with distance 4
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (1,2).


Example 3:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/30/example3.png]


Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[0,0,1],[2,3,4]], pricing = [2,3], start = [0,0], k = 3
Output: [[2,1],[2,0]]
Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,3], we can take items from (2,0) and (2,1). 
The ranks of these items are: 
- (2,1) with distance 5
- (2,0) with distance 6
Thus, the 2 highest ranked items in the price range are (2,1) and (2,0). 
Note that k = 3 but there are only 2 reachable items within the price range.

Count the Hidden Sequences - You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences, which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1). More formally, call the hidden sequence hidden, then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i].

You are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain.

 * For example, given differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length 4 whose elements are in between 1 and 6 (inclusive).
   * [3, 4, 1, 5] and [4, 5, 2, 6] are possible hidden sequences.
   * [5, 6, 3, 7] is not possible since it contains an element greater than 6.
   * [1, 2, 3, 4] is not possible since the differences are not correct.

Return the number of possible hidden sequences there are. If there are no possible sequences, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Minimum Cost of Buying Candies With Discount - A shop is selling candies at a discount. For every two candies sold, the shop gives a third candy for free.

The customer can choose any candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the minimum cost of the two candies bought.

 * For example, if there are 4 candies with costs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the customer buys candies with costs 2 and 3, they can take the candy with cost 1 for free, but not the candy with cost 4.

Given a 0-indexed integer array cost, where cost[i] denotes the cost of the ith candy, return the minimum cost of buying all the candies.

 

Example 1:


Input: cost = [1,2,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the only way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.


Example 2:


Input: cost = [6,5,7,9,2,2]
Output: 23
Explanation: The way in which we can get the minimum cost is described below:
- Buy candies with costs 9 and 7
- Take the candy with cost 6 for free
- We buy candies with costs 5 and 2
- Take the last remaining candy with cost 2 for free
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 9 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 23.


Example 3:


Input: cost = [5,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: Since there are only 2 candies, we buy both of them. There is not a third candy we can take for free.
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 5 + 5 = 10.

Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting - A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of n employees, waiting to be invited.

The employees are numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee has a favorite person and they will attend the meeting only if they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is not themself.

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/12/14/ex1.png]


Input: favorite = [2,2,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The above figure shows how the company can invite employees 0, 1, and 2, and seat them at the round table.
All employees cannot be invited because employee 2 cannot sit beside employees 0, 1, and 3, simultaneously.
Note that the company can also invite employees 1, 2, and 3, and give them their desired seats.
The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3. 


Example 2:


Input: favorite = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Each employee is the favorite person of at least one other employee, and the only way the company can invite them is if they invite every employee.
The seating arrangement will be the same as that in the figure given in example 1:
- Employee 0 will sit between employees 2 and 1.

Example 1:


Input: mass = 10, asteroids = [3,9,19,5,21]
Output: true
Explanation: One way to order the asteroids is [9,19,5,3,21]:
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 19. New planet mass: 19 + 19 = 38
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 5. New planet mass: 38 + 5 = 43
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 3. New planet mass: 43 + 3 = 46
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 21. New planet mass: 46 + 21 = 67

Example 2:

Recover the Original Array - Alice had a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers. She chose an arbitrary positive integer k and created two new 0-indexed integer arrays lower and higher in the following manner:

 1. lower[i] = arr[i] - k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n
 2. higher[i] = arr[i] + k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.

Given an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher, return the original array arr. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.

Note: The test cases are generated such that there exists at least one valid array arr.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
Output: [3,7,11]
Explanation:
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.
Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. 


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,1,3,3]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].
Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.
Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.
This is invalid since k must be positive.


Example 3:


Input: nums = [5,435]
Output: [220]
Explanation:
The only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215. Using them, we get lower = [5] and higher = [435].

Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing - You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.

The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.

 * For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:
   * arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
   * arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
   * arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
   * arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)
 * However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).

In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.


Example 2:


Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.

Example 3:


Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.

The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:

 * Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the 0th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the (n - 1)th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.
 * It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.
 * Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.
 * In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.

- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.
- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.

- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.
- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.
So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.

Input: rings = ""B0B6G0R6R0R6G9""
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- The rod labeled 0 holds 3 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.
- The rod labeled 6 holds 3 rings, but it only has red and blue.
- The rod labeled 9 holds only a green ring.
Thus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.

Input: rings = ""B0R0G0R9R0B0G0""
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- The rod labeled 0 holds 6 rings with all colors: red, green, and blue.
- The rod labeled 9 holds only a red ring.
Thus, the number of rods with all three colors is 1.


Example 3:

Abbreviating the Product of a Range - You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].

Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:

 1. Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.
    * For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.
 2. Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.
    * For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.
 3. Finally, represent the product as a string ""<pre>...<suf>eC"".
    * For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as ""12345...89876e5"".

Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].

 

Example 1:


Input: left = 1, right = 4
Output: ""24e0""
Explanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24.
There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with ""e0"".
Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.
Thus, the final representation is ""24e0"".


Example 2:


Input: left = 2, right = 11
Output: ""399168e2""
Explanation: The product is 39916800.
There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with ""e2"".
The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further.
Hence, the abbreviated product is ""399168e2"".


Example 3:


Input: left = 371, right = 375
Output: ""7219856259e3""

You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei] indicates that person xi and person yi have a meeting at timei. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson.

Person 0 has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice versa.

The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.

Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.

There is an element in nums that has the lowest value and an element that has the highest value. We call them the minimum and maximum respectively. Your goal is to remove both these elements from the array.

A deletion is defined as either removing an element from the front of the array or removing an element from the back of the array.

Return the minimum number of deletions it would take to remove both the minimum and maximum element from the array.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.

The k-radius average for a subarray of nums centered at some index i with the radius k is the average of all elements in nums between the indices i - k and i + k (inclusive). If there are less than k elements before or after the index i, then the k-radius average is -1.

Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The higher the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the lexicographically smaller name is better.

You are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:

 * Adding scenic locations, one at a time.
 * Querying the ith best location of all locations already added, where i is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).
   * For example, when the system is queried for the 4th time, it returns the 4th best location of all locations already added.

Note that the test data are generated so that at any time, the number of queries does not exceed the number of locations added to the system.

Implement the SORTracker class:

 * SORTracker() Initializes the tracker system.
 * void add(string name, int score) Adds a scenic location with name and score to the system.
 * string get() Queries and returns the ith best location, where i is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).

Detonate the Maximum Bombs - You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a circle with the center as the location of the bomb.

The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]. xi and yi denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the ith bomb, whereas ri denotes the radius of its range.

You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.

Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb.

Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.
So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.

Input: bombs = [[1,1,5],[10,10,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.

Output: 5
Explanation:
The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:
- Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.
- Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.
- Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.
Thus all 5 bombs are detonated.

Find Good Days to Rob the Bank - You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a 0-indexed integer array security, where security[i] is the number of guards on duty on the ith day. The days are numbered starting from 0. You are also given an integer time.

The ith day is a good day to rob the bank if:

 * There are at least time days before and after the ith day,
 * The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and
 * The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing.

More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time].

Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.

 

Example 1:


Input: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
On day 2, we have security[0] >= security[1] >= security[2] <= security[3] <= security[4].
On day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5].
No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.


Example 2:


Input: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
Since time equals 0, every day is a good day to rob the bank, so return every day.


Example 3:


Input: security = [1,2,3,4,5,6], time = 2
Output: []
Explanation:
No day has 2 days before it that have a non-increasing number of guards.
Thus, no day is a good day to rob the bank, so return an empty list.

Decode the Slanted Ciphertext - A string originalText is encoded using a slanted transposition cipher to a string encodedText with the help of a matrix having a fixed number of rows rows.

originalText is placed first in a top-left to bottom-right manner.

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/07/exa11.png]

The blue cells are filled first, followed by the red cells, then the yellow cells, and so on, until we reach the end of originalText. The arrow indicates the order in which the cells are filled. All empty cells are filled with ' '. The number of columns is chosen such that the rightmost column will not be empty after filling in originalText.

encodedText is then formed by appending all characters of the matrix in a row-wise fashion.

Count Fertile Pyramids in a Land - A farmer has a rectangular grid of land with m rows and n columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either fertile (represented by a 1) or barren (represented by a 0). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.

A pyramidal plot of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:

 1. The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
 2. The apex of a pyramid is the topmost cell of the pyramid. The height of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r <= i <= r + h - 1 and c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r).

Maximum Path Quality of a Graph - There is an undirected graph with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive). You are given a 0-indexed integer array values where values[i] is the value of the ith node. You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges, where each edges[j] = [uj, vj, timej] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes uj and vj, and it takes timej seconds to travel between the two nodes. Finally, you are given an integer maxTime.

A valid path in the graph is any path that starts at node 0, ends at node 0, and takes at most maxTime seconds to complete. You may visit the same node multiple times. The quality of a valid path is the sum of the values of the unique nodes visited in the path (each node's value is added at most once to the sum).

Return the maximum quality of a valid path.

There are m product types of varying amounts, which are given as a 0-indexed integer array quantities, where quantities[i] represents the number of products of the ith product type.

You need to distribute all products to the retail stores following these rules:

 * A store can only be given at most one product type but can be given any amount of it.
 * After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly 0). Let x represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want x to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to minimize the maximum number of products that are given to any store.

Return the minimum possible x.

 

Example 1:

 * Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
 * Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.

For example, one way to encode an original string ""abcdefghijklmnop"" might be:

 * Split it as a sequence: [""ab"", ""cdefghijklmn"", ""o"", ""p""].
 * Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes [""ab"", ""12"", ""1"", ""p""].
 * Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: ""ab121p"".

Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points - A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima.

A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance, maxDistance] where minDistance is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and maxDistance is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1].

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a1.png]


Input: head = [3,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a2.png]


Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.


Example 3:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/14/a5.png]


Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
Output: [3,3]
Explanation: There are two critical points:
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.

Input: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]
Explanation:
- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4].

- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].

Course 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.
Course 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.
Thus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.

Count Nodes With the Highest Score - There is a binary tree rooted at 0 consisting of n nodes. The nodes are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 0-indexed integer array parents representing the tree, where parents[i] is the parent of node i. Since node 0 is the root, parents[0] == -1.

Each node has a score. To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were removed. The tree would become one or more non-empty subtrees. The size of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The score of the node is the product of the sizes of all those subtrees.

Second Minimum Time to Reach Destination - A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with n vertices where each vertex is labeled from 1 to n (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is time minutes.

Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every change minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.

Check if Numbers Are Ascending in a Sentence - A sentence is a list of tokens separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Every token is either a positive number consisting of digits 0-9 with no leading zeros, or a word consisting of lowercase English letters.

 * For example, ""a puppy has 2 eyes 4 legs"" is a sentence with seven tokens: ""2"" and ""4"" are numbers and the other tokens such as ""puppy"" are words.

Given a string s representing a sentence, you need to check if all the numbers in s are strictly increasing from left to right (i.e., other than the last number, each number is strictly smaller than the number on its right in s).

Return true if so, or false otherwise.

Number of Valid Move Combinations On Chessboard - There is an 8 x 8 chessboard containing n pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array pieces of length n, where pieces[i] describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the ith piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array positions also of length n, where positions[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that the ith piece is currently at the 1-based coordinate (ri, ci) on the chessboard.

When making a move for a piece, you choose a destination square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.

 * A rook can only travel horizontally or vertically from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), or (r, c-1).
 * A queen can only travel horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1), (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).
 * A bishop can only travel diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).

You must make a move for every piece on the board simultaneously. A move combination consists of all the moves performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel one square towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the 0th second. A move combination is invalid if, at a given time, two or more pieces occupy the same square.

Return the number of valid move combinations .

Notes:

 * No two pieces will start in the same square.
 * You may choose the square a piece is already on as its destination.
 * If two pieces are directly adjacent to each other, it is valid for them to move past each other and swap positions in one second.

Stock Price Fluctuation  - You are given a stream of records about a particular stock. Each record contains a timestamp and the corresponding price of the stock at that timestamp.

Unfortunately due to the volatile nature of the stock market, the records do not come in order. Even worse, some records may be incorrect. Another record with the same timestamp may appear later in the stream correcting the price of the previous wrong record.

Design an algorithm that:

 * Updates the price of the stock at a particular timestamp, correcting the price from any previous records at the timestamp.
 * Finds the latest price of the stock based on the current records. The latest price is the price at the latest timestamp recorded.
 * Finds the maximum price the stock has been based on the current records.
 * Finds the minimum price the stock has been based on the current records.

Implement the StockPrice class:

 * StockPrice() Initializes the object with no price records.
 * void update(int timestamp, int price) Updates the price of the stock at the given timestamp.
 * int current() Returns the latest price of the stock.
 * int maximum() Returns the maximum price of the stock.
 * int minimum() Returns the minimum price of the stock.

There is a row of n stones, and each stone has an associated value. You are given an integer array stones, where stones[i] is the value of the ith stone.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each turn, the player may remove any stone from stones. The player who removes a stone loses if the sum of the values of all removed stones is divisible by 3. Bob will win automatically if there are no remaining stones (even if it is Alice's turn).

Assuming both players play optimally, return true if Alice wins and false if Bob wins.

 

Example 1:


Input: stones = [2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The game will be played as follows:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove either stone.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the remaining stone. 
The sum of the removed stones is 1 + 2 = 3 and is divisible by 3. Therefore, Bob loses and Alice wins the game.


Example 2:


Input: stones = [2]
Output: false
Explanation: Alice will remove the only stone, and the sum of the values on the removed stones is 2. 
Since all the stones are removed and the sum of values is not divisible by 3, Bob wins the game.


Example 3:


Input: stones = [5,1,2,4,3]
Output: false
Explanation: Bob will always win. One possible way for Bob to win is shown below:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove the second stone with value 1. Sum of removed stones = 1.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the fifth stone with value 3. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 = 4.
- Turn 3: Alices removes the fourth stone with value 4. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.
- Turn 4: Bob removes the third stone with value 2. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 10.
- Turn 5: Alice removes the first stone with value 5. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 15.
Alice loses the game because the sum of the removed stones (15) is divisible by 3. Bob wins the game.

Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], patience = [0,2,1]
Output: 8
Explanation:
At (the beginning of) second 0,
- Data server 1 sends its message (denoted 1A) to the master server.
- Data server 2 sends its message (denoted 2A) to the master server.

At second 1,
- Message 1A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 1A instantly and sends a reply 1A back.
- Server 1 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 < patience[1] = 2) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it does not resend the message.
- Server 2 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 == patience[2] = 1) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it resends the message (denoted 2B).

At second 2,
- The reply 1A arrives at server 1. No more resending will occur from server 1.
- Message 2A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 2A instantly and sends a reply 2A back.
- Server 2 resends the message (denoted 2C).
...
At second 4,
- The reply 2A arrives at server 2. No more resending will occur from server 2.
...
At second 7, reply 2D arrives at server 2.

Starting from the beginning of the second 8, there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.
This is the time when the network becomes idle.

Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color - There are n pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by 'A' or by 'B'. You are given a string colors of length n where colors[i] is the color of the ith piece.

Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take alternating turns removing pieces from the line. In this game, Alice moves first.

 * Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'A' if both its neighbors are also colored 'A'. She is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'B'.
 * Bob is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'B' if both its neighbors are also colored 'B'. He is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'A'.
 * Alice and Bob cannot remove pieces from the edge of the line.
 * If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player loses and the other player wins.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins, or return false if Bob wins.

 

Example 1:


Input: colors = ""AAABABB""
Output: true
Explanation:
AAABABB -> AABABB
Alice moves first.
She removes the second 'A' from the left since that is the only 'A' whose neighbors are both 'A'.

Now it's Bob's turn.
Bob cannot make a move on his turn since there are no 'B's whose neighbors are both 'B'.
Thus, Alice wins, so return true.


Example 2:


Input: colors = ""AA""
Output: false
Explanation:
Alice has her turn first.
There are only two 'A's and both are on the edge of the line, so she cannot move on her turn.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.


Example 3:


Input: colors = ""ABBBBBBBAAA""
Output: false
Explanation:
ABBBBBBBAAA -> ABBBBBBBAA
Alice moves first.
Her only option is to remove the second to last 'A' from the right.

ABBBBBBBAA -> ABBBBBBAA
Next is Bob's turn.
He has many options for which 'B' piece to remove. He can pick any.

On Alice's second turn, she has no more pieces that she can remove.
Thus, Bob wins, so return false.

The Score of Students Solving Math Expression - You are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2). This expression was given to n elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this order of operations:

 1. Compute multiplication, reading from left to right; Then,
 2. Compute addition, reading from left to right.

You are given an integer array answers of length n, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the answers, by following these rules:

 * If an answer equals the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded 5 points;
 * Otherwise, if the answer could be interpreted as if the student applied the operators in the wrong order but had correct arithmetic, this student will be rewarded 2 points;
 * Otherwise, this student will be rewarded 0 points.

Output: 7
Explanation: As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: [20,13,42]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)*1)*2 = 20. Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: [20,13,42]
The points for the students are: [2,5,0]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""3+5*2"", answers = [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
Output: 19
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
The points for the students are: [5,0,0,5,5,2,2]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.


Example 3:


Input: s = ""6+0*1"", answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]
Output: 10
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 6.
If a student had incorrectly done (6+0)*1, the answer would also be 6.
By the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.

Grid Game - You are given a 0-indexed 2D array grid of size 2 x n, where grid[r][c] represents the number of points at position (r, c) on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.

Both robots initially start at (0, 0) and want to reach (1, n-1). Each robot may only move to the right ((r, c) to (r, c + 1)) or down ((r, c) to (r + 1, c)).

At the start of the game, the first robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting all the points from the cells on its path. For all cells (r, c) traversed on the path, grid[r][c] is set to 0. Then, the second robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting the points on its path. Note that their paths may intersect with one another.

The first robot wants to minimize the number of points collected by the second robot. In contrast, the second robot wants to maximize the number of points it collects. If both robots play optimally, return the number of points collected by the second robot.

He wants to confuse the students by maximizing the number of consecutive questions with the same answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).

You are given a string answerKey, where answerKey[i] is the original answer to the ith question. In addition, you are given an integer k, the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:

 * Change the answer key for any question to 'T' or 'F' (i.e., set answerKey[i] to 'T' or 'F').

Return the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing the operation at most k times.

 

Example 1:


Input: answerKey = ""TTFF"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey = ""TTTT"".

First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms - There are n rooms you need to visit, labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each day is labeled, starting from 0. You will go in and visit one room a day.

Initially on day 0, you visit room 0. The order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextVisit of length n:

 * Assuming that on a day, you visit room i,
 * if you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit a room with a lower or equal room number specified by nextVisit[i] where 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i;
 * if you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit room (i + 1) mod n.

Return the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: nextVisit = [0,0]

Explanation:
- On day 0, you visit room 0. The total times you have been in room 0 is 1, which is odd.
  On the next day you will visit room nextVisit[0] = 0
- On day 1, you visit room 0, The total times you have been in room 0 is 2, which is even.

Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks - There are n tasks assigned to you. The task times are represented as an integer array tasks of length n, where the ith task takes tasks[i] hours to finish. A work session is when you work for at most sessionTime consecutive hours and then take a break.

You should finish the given tasks in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

 * If you start a task in a work session, you must complete it in the same work session.
 * You can start a new task immediately after finishing the previous one.
 * You may complete the tasks in any order.

Given tasks and sessionTime, return the minimum number of work sessions needed to finish all the tasks following the conditions above.

Operations on Tree - You are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of the ith node. The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.

The data structure should support the following functions:

 * Lock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.
 * Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.
 * Upgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:
   * The node is unlocked,
   * It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and
   * It does not have any locked ancestors.

Implement the LockingTree class:

 * LockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.
 * lock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user.
 * unlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to unlock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become unlocked.
 * upgrade(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to upgrade the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will be upgraded.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

land can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of land is (0, 0) and the bottom right corner of land is (m-1, n-1). Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each group of farmland. A group of farmland with a top left corner at (r1, c1) and a bottom right corner at (r2, c2) is represented by the 4-length array [r1, c1, r2, c2].

Minimum Non-Zero Product of the Array Elements - You are given a positive integer p. Consider an array nums (1-indexed) that consists of the integers in the inclusive range [1, 2p - 1] in their binary representations. You are allowed to do the following operation any number of times:

 * Choose two elements x and y from nums.
 * Choose a bit in x and swap it with its corresponding bit in y. Corresponding bit refers to the bit that is in the same position in the other integer.

For example, if x = 1101 and y = 0011, after swapping the 2nd bit from the right, we have x = 1111 and y = 0001.

Find the minimum non-zero product of nums after performing the above operation any number of times. Return this product modulo 109 + 7.

There is only one element, so the product equals that element.


Example 2:


Input: p = 2

 * For example, [""one"", ""two"", ""three""] represents the path ""/one/two/three"".

Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.

 * For example, folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:

Maximum Compatibility Score Sum - There is a survey that consists of n questions where each question's answer is either 0 (no) or 1 (yes).

The survey was given to m students numbered from 0 to m - 1 and m mentors numbered from 0 to m - 1. The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array students where students[i] is an integer array that contains the answers of the ith student (0-indexed). The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array mentors where mentors[j] is an integer array that contains the answers of the jth mentor (0-indexed).

Each student will be assigned to one mentor, and each mentor will have one student assigned to them. The compatibility score of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.

 * For example, if the student's answers were [1, 0, 1] and the mentor's answers were [0, 0, 1], then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.

You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to maximize the sum of the compatibility scores.

Given students and mentors, return the maximum compatibility score sum that can be achieved.

Input: students = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]], mentors = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]

Explanation: We assign students to mentors in the following way:
- student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
- student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
- student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array change of length 10 that maps each digit 0-9 to another digit. More formally, digit d maps to digit change[d].

You may choose to mutate a single substring of num. To mutate a substring, replace each digit num[i] with the digit it maps to in change (i.e. replace num[i] with change[num[i]]).

Return a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating (or choosing not to) a single substring of num.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

Example 1:


Input: num = ""132"", change = [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8]
Output: ""832""
Explanation: Replace the substring ""1"":
- 1 maps to change[1] = 8.
Thus, ""132"" becomes ""832"".
""832"" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.


Example 2:


Input: num = ""021"", change = [9,4,3,5,7,2,1,9,0,6]

Explanation: Replace the substring ""021"":
- 0 maps to change[0] = 9.
- 2 maps to change[2] = 3.
- 1 maps to change[1] = 4.
Thus, ""021"" becomes ""934"".

Sum of Digits of String After Convert - You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer k.

First, convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total.

For example, if s = ""zbax"" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:

 * Convert: ""zbax"" ➝ ""(26)(2)(1)(24)"" ➝ ""262124"" ➝ 262124
 * Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17

Maximum Genetic Difference Query - There is a rooted tree consisting of n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1. Each node's number denotes its unique genetic value (i.e. the genetic value of node x is x). The genetic difference between two genetic values is defined as the bitwise-XOR of their values. You are given the integer array parents, where parents[i] is the parent for node i. If node x is the root of the tree, then parents[x] == -1.

Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time - There is a country of n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 where all the cities are connected by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei] denotes a road between cities xi and yi that takes timei minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a 0-indexed integer array passingFees of length n where passingFees[j] is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city j.

In the beginning, you are at city 0 and want to reach city n - 1 in maxTime minutes or less. The cost of your journey is the summation of passing fees for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (including the source and destination cities).

Given maxTime, edges, and passingFees, return the minimum cost to complete your journey, or -1 if you cannot complete it within maxTime minutes.

You are given a string num of even length consisting of digits and '?' characters. On each turn, a player will do the following if there is still at least one '?' in num:

 1. Choose an index i where num[i] == '?'.
 2. Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.

The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.

For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.

 * For example, if the game ended with num = ""243801"", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = ""243803"", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice will win and false if Bob will win.

 

Example 1:


Input: num = ""5023""
Output: false
Explanation: There are no moves to be made.
The sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half: 5 + 0 = 2 + 3.


Example 2:


Input: num = ""25??""
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can replace one of the '?'s with '9' and it will be impossible for Bob to make the sums equal.


Example 3:


Input: num = ""?3295???""
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that Bob will always win. One possible outcome is:
- Alice replaces the first '?' with '9'. num = ""93295???"".

Minimum Absolute Difference Queries - The minimum absolute difference of an array a is defined as the minimum value of |a[i] - a[j]|, where 0 <= i < j < a.length and a[i] != a[j]. If all elements of a are the same, the minimum absolute difference is -1.

 * For example, the minimum absolute difference of the array [5,2,3,7,2] is |2 - 3| = 1. Note that it is not 0 because a[i] and a[j] must be different.

You are given an integer array nums and the array queries where queries[i] = [li, ri]. For each query i, compute the minimum absolute difference of the subarray nums[li...ri] containing the elements of nums between the 0-based indices li and ri (inclusive).

Return an array ans where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.

Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors - You are given two identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.

You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.

In each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.


Example 2:


Input: n = 100
Output: 14
Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.

The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete - There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).

The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

 * For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
   * Player 1 competes against player 7.
   * Player 2 competes against player 6.
   * Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.

After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).

The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.

Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively.

You want to choose an integer k (0 <= k <= removable.length) such that, after removing k characters from s using the first k indices in removable, p is still a subsequence of s. More formally, you will mark the character at s[removable[i]] for each 0 <= i < k, then remove all marked characters and check if p is still a subsequence.

Design Movie Rental System - You have a movie renting company consisting of n shops. You want to implement a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies. The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies.

Each movie is given as a 2D integer array entries where entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei] indicates that there is a copy of movie moviei at shop shopi with a rental price of pricei. Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie moviei.

The system should support the following functions:

 * Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.
 * Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.
 * Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.
 * Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list res where res[j] = [shopj, moviej] describes that the jth cheapest rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj. The movies in res should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopj should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the smaller moviej should appear first. If there are fewer than 5 rented movies, then all of them should be returned. If no movies are currently being rented, then an empty list should be returned.

The package sizes are given as an integer array packages, where packages[i] is the size of the ith package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.

You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.

 * For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.

Minimum Skips to Arrive at Meeting On Time - You are given an integer hoursBefore, the number of hours you have to travel to your meeting. To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.

After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.

 * For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait.

However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.

 * For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.

Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.

 

Example 1:


Input: dist = [1,3,2], speed = 4, hoursBefore = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (1/4 + 3/4) + (3/4 + 1/4) + (2/4) = 2.5 hours.
You can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) = 1.5 hours.
Note that the second rest is shortened because you finish traveling the second road at an integer hour due to skipping the first rest.


Example 2:


Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 2, hoursBefore = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (7/2 + 1/2) + (3/2 + 1/2) + (5/2 + 1/2) + (5/2) = 11.5 hours.
You can skip the first and third rest to arrive in ((7/2 + 0) + (3/2 + 0)) + ((5/2 + 0) + (5/2)) = 10 hours.


Example 3:

Tasks are assigned to the servers using a task queue. Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is empty.

At second j, the jth task is inserted into the queue (starting with the 0th task being inserted at second 0). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the smallest index.

If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned in order of insertion following the weight and index priorities above.

Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk - There are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.

Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.

 

Example 1:


Input: chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22
Output: 0
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.

Example 2:


Input: chalk = [3,4,1,2], k = 25
Output: 1
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 22.
- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 18.
- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 17.
- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 15.
- Student number 0 uses 3 chalk so k = 12.
- Student number 1 uses 4 chalk so k = 8.
- Student number 2 uses 1 chalk so k = 7.
- Student number 3 uses 2 chalk so k = 5.

There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is more than one, they will do the following:

 1. Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row.
 2. Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score.
 3. Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when only one stone is left in the row.

The score difference between Alice and Bob is (Alice's score - Bob's score). Alice's goal is to maximize the score difference, and Bob's goal is the minimize the score difference.

Given an integer array stones of length n where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the score difference between Alice and Bob if they both play optimally.

 

Example 1:


Input: stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5]

  value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5].
- Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on

To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ith train ride.

Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.

Maximum Element After Decreasing and Rearranging - You are given an array of positive integers arr. Perform some operations (possibly none) on arr so that it satisfies these conditions:

 * The value of the first element in arr must be 1.
 * The absolute difference between any 2 adjacent elements must be less than or equal to 1. In other words, abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) <= 1 for each i where 1 <= i < arr.length (0-indexed). abs(x) is the absolute value of x.

 * Decrease the value of any element of arr to a smaller positive integer.
 * Rearrange the elements of arr to be in any order.

Return the maximum possible value of an element in arr after performing the operations to satisfy the conditions.

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [2,2,1,2,1]

Explanation: 
We can satisfy the conditions by rearranging arr so it becomes [1,2,2,2,1].
The largest element in arr is 2.


Example 2:


Input: arr = [100,1,1000]

One possible way to satisfy the conditions is by doing the following:
1. Rearrange arr so it becomes [1,100,1000].
2. Decrease the value of the second element to 2.
3. Decrease the value of the third element to 3.

Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]

Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,7,5] => [1,1,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,7,5] => [1,5,5].
Both will yield an absolute sum difference of |1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| = 3.


Example 2:


Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums1 is equal to nums2 so no replacement is needed. This will result in an 
absolute sum difference of 0.

Finding the Users Active Minutes - You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi, timei] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute timei.

Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.

Return the array answer as described above.

 

Example 1:


Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5

Explanation:
The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).
The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.


Example 2:


Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.
The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.
Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.

- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.

Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.
- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.

- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

Number of Restricted Paths From First to Last Node - There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer n which denotes that the graph has n nodes labeled from 1 to n, and an array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti] denotes that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi with weight equal to weighti.

A path from node start to node end is a sequence of nodes [z0, z1, z2, ..., zk] such that z0 = start and zk = end and there is an edge between zi and zi+1 where 0 <= i <= k-1.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let distanceToLastNode(x) denote the shortest distance of a path between node n and node x. A restricted path is a path that also satisfies that distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1) where 0 <= i <= k-1.

Return the number of restricted paths from node 1 to node n. Since that number may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Car Fleet II - There are n cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array cars of length n, where cars[i] = [positioni, speedi] represents:

 * positioni is the distance between the ith car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that positioni < positioni+1.
 * speedi is the initial speed of the ith car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the slowest car in the fleet.

Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the time, in seconds, at which the ith car collides with the next car, or -1 if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answers are accepted.

Input: cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.

+-------------+------+
(emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key of this table.
The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
event_day is the day at which this event happened, in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at which they left the office.
in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.
It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, and in_time < out_time.


 

Write an SQL query to calculate the total time in minutes spent by each employee on each day at the office. Note that within one day, an employee can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in the office for a single entry is out_time - in_time.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

You want to choose a subsequence of nums such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to goal. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is sum, then you want to minimize the absolute difference abs(sum - goal).

Return the minimum possible value of abs(sum - goal).

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements (possibly all or none) of the original array.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5

Largest Merge Of Two Strings - You are given two strings word1 and word2. You want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:

 * If word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.
   * For example, if word1 = ""abc"" and merge = ""dv"", then after choosing this operation, word1 = ""bc"" and merge = ""dva"".
 * If word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.
   * For example, if word2 = ""abc"" and merge = """", then after choosing this operation, word2 = ""bc"" and merge = ""a"".

Return the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.

A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. For example, ""abcd"" is lexicographically larger than ""abcc"" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.

 

Example 1:


Input: word1 = ""cabaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
Output: ""cbcabaaaaa""
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = ""c"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cb"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""caaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cbc"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""aaa""

 * arrivali is the arrival time of the ith customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order.
 * timei is the time needed to prepare the order of the ith customer.

When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order.

Example 1:


Input: customers = [[1,2],[2,5],[4,3]]
Output: 5.00000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 1, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 1, and finishes at time 3, so the waiting time of the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 2, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 3, and finishes at time 8, so the waiting time of the second customer is 8 - 2 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 4, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 8, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the third customer is 11 - 4 = 7.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.

Input: customers = [[5,2],[5,4],[10,3],[20,1]]

Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 5, and finishes at time 7, so the waiting time of the first customer is 7 - 5 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 7, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the second customer is 11 - 5 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 10, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 11, and finishes at time 14, so the waiting time of the third customer is 14 - 10 = 4.
4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the waiting time of the fourth customer is 21 - 20 = 1.

Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch - The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.

The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:

 * If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
 * Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.

This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue).

Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary - You are given an integer array nums of even length n and an integer limit. In one move, you can replace any integer from nums with another integer between 1 and limit, inclusive.

The array nums is complementary if for all indices i (0-indexed), nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] equals the same number. For example, the array [1,2,3,4] is complementary because for all indices i, nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] = 5.

Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports - You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.

You are given an array boxes, where boxes[i] = [ports i , weighti], and three integers portsCount, maxBoxes, and maxWeight.

 * ports i is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is the weight of the ith box.
 * portsCount is the number of ports.
 * maxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.

The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:

 * The ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
 * For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.
 * The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.

The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.

Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.

 

Example 1:


Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.
So the total number of trips is 4.
Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).


Example 2:


Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Input: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7

Return the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.

 

Example 1:


Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[4,8]]
Output: 8

Ways to Make a Fair Array - You are given an integer array nums. You can choose exactly one index (0-indexed) and remove the element. Notice that the index of the elements may change after the removal.

For example, if nums = [6,1,7,4,1]:

Maximize Grid Happiness - You are given four integers, m, n, introvertsCount, and extrovertsCount. You have an m x n grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are introvertsCount introverts and extrovertsCount extroverts.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.

The happiness of each person is calculated as follows:

 * Introverts start with 120 happiness and lose 30 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
 * Extroverts start with 40 happiness and gain 20 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

The grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/grid_happiness.png]


Input: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
Output: 240
Explanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.


Example 2:


Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

Design an Ordered Stream - There is a stream of n (idKey, value) pairs arriving in an arbitrary order, where idKey is an integer between 1 and n and value is a string. No two pairs have the same id.

Design a stream that returns the values in increasing order of their IDs by returning a chunk (list) of values after each insertion. The concatenation of all the chunks should result in a list of the sorted values.

Implement the OrderedStream class:

 * OrderedStream(int n) Constructs the stream to take n values.
 * String[] insert(int idKey, String value) Inserts the pair (idKey, value) into the stream, then returns the largest possible chunk of currently inserted values that appear next in the order.

Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls - You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants orders balls of any color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your inventory. For example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, inventory, where inventory[i] represents the number of balls of the ith color that you initially own. You are also given an integer orders, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.

- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.

Arithmetic Subarrays - A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence s is arithmetic if and only if s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] for all valid i.

For example, these are arithmetic sequences:


1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Both arrays are 0-indexed. The 0th key was pressed at the time 0, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact time the previous key was released.

The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. The ith keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1], and the 0th keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[0].

Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key may not have had the same duration.

Choose an index and split both strings at the same index, splitting a into two strings: aprefix and asuffix where a = aprefix + asuffix, and splitting b into two strings: bprefix and bsuffix where b = bprefix + bsuffix. Check if aprefix + bsuffix or bprefix + asuffix forms a palindrome.

When you split a string s into sprefix and ssuffix, either ssuffix or sprefix is allowed to be empty. For example, if s = ""abc"", then """" + ""abc"", ""a"" + ""bc"", ""ab"" + ""c"" , and ""abc"" + """" are valid splits.

Return true if it is possible to form a palindrome string, otherwise return false.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

 * Mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.
 * During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the grid.
 * catJump, mouseJump are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.

Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality - You are given an array of network towers towers, where towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi] denotes the ith network tower with location (xi, yi) and quality factor qi. All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between the two coordinates is the Euclidean distance.

You are also given an integer radius where a tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to radius. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.

The signal quality of the ith tower at a coordinate (x, y) is calculated with the formula ⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋, where d is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.

Return the array [cx, cy] representing the integral coordinate (cx, cy) where the network quality is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, return the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate.

Note:

 * A coordinate (x1, y1) is lexicographically smaller than (x2, y2) if either:
   * x1 < x2, or
   * x1 == x2 and y1 < y2.
 * ⌊val⌋ is the greatest integer less than or equal to val (the floor function).

Input: towers = [[1,2,5],[2,1,7],[3,1,9]], radius = 2
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13.
- Quality of 7 from (2, 1) results in ⌊7 / (1 + sqrt(0)⌋ = ⌊7⌋ = 7
- Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in ⌊5 / (1 + sqrt(2)⌋ = ⌊2.07⌋ = 2
- Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in ⌊9 / (1 + sqrt(1)⌋ = ⌊4.5⌋ = 4
No other coordinate has a higher network quality.

Example 2:


Input: towers = [[23,11,21]], radius = 9
Output: [23,11]
Explanation: Since there is only one tower, the network quality is highest right at the tower's location.

Throne Inheritance - A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.


Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder


For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.

 1. In the beginning, curOrder will be [""king""].
 2. Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice""].
 3. Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""].
 4. Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].
 5. Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.

Implement the ThroneInheritance class:

 * ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.
 * void birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.
 * void death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn't affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.
 * string[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel - You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.

You are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.

You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.

Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return -1.

Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.
2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.
3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.

2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.
3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.
4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.
5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.
6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.

Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points - You are given two groups of points where the first group has size1 points, the second group has size2 points, and size1 >= size2.

The cost of the connection between any two points are given in an size1 x size2 matrix where cost[i][j] is the cost of connecting point i of the first group and point j of the second group. The groups are connected if each point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the opposite group. In other words, each point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.

Return the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/03/ex1.jpg]


Input: cost = [[15, 96], [36, 2]]
Output: 17
Explanation: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
This results in a total cost of 17.


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/03/ex2.jpg]


Input: cost = [[1, 3, 5], [4, 1, 1], [1, 5, 3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
2--C
3--A
This results in a total cost of 4.
Note that there are multiple points connected to point 2 in the first group and point A in the second group. This does not matter as there is no limit to the number of points that can be connected. We only care about the minimum total cost.

All of the servers start out available.
The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.

Explanation: 
The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.

Design Parking System - Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the ParkingSystem class:

 * ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
 * bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.

In each round of the game, Alice divides the row into two non-empty rows (i.e. left row and right row), then Bob calculates the value of each row which is the sum of the values of all the stones in this row. Bob throws away the row which has the maximum value, and Alice's score increases by the value of the remaining row. If the value of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide which row will be thrown away. The next round starts with the remaining row.

Explanation: In the first round, Alice divides the row to [6,2,3], [4,5,5]. The left row has the value 11 and the right row has value 14. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 11.
In the second round Alice divides the row to [6], [2,3]. This time Bob throws away the left row and Alice's score becomes 16 (11 + 5).

Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/21/e11.jpg]
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

Detect Cycles in 2D Grid - Given a 2D array of characters grid of size m x n, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the same value in grid.

A cycle is a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the same value of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) is invalid because from (1, 2) we visited (1, 1) which was the last visited cell.

Return true if any cycle of the same value exists in grid, otherwise, return false.

Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/09/e1.jpg]


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], distance = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: The leaf nodes of the tree are 3 and 4 and the length of the shortest path between them is 3. This is the only good pair.


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/09/e2.jpg]


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], distance = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The good pairs are [4,5] and [6,7] with shortest path = 2. The pair [4,6] is not good because the length of ther shortest path between them is 4.


Example 3:


Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2], distance = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: The only good pair is [2,5].

 * Choose any index j (1-indexed) from s, such that 1 <= j <= s.length and j has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index i times.
 * Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Shifting a character by i means applying the shift operations i times.

Remember that any index j can be picked at most once.

Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings - Given a string s of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of s that meet the following conditions:

 1. The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[x..y], either j < x or i > y is true.
 2. A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.

Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.

  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",

If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings.

String Compression II - Run-length encoding [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding] is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string ""aabccc"" we replace ""aa"" by ""a2"" and replace ""ccc"" by ""c3"". Thus the compressed string becomes ""a2bc3"".

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.

Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be ""a3c3"" of length 4.

Example 2:


Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be ""a4"" of length 2.


Example 3:


Input: s = ""aaaaaaaaaaa"", k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is ""a11"" of length 3.

Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank - We have a wooden plank of the length n units. Some ants are walking on the plank, each ant moves with a speed of 1 unit per second. Some of the ants move to the left, the other move to the right.

When two ants moving in two different directions meet at some point, they change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions does not take any additional time.

When an ant reaches one end of the plank at a time t, it falls out of the plank immediately.

Given an integer n and two integer arrays left and right, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right, return the moment when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank.

-The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right.
-The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left.
-The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left.
The last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 seconds. After that, it falls immediately out of the plank. (i.e., We can say that at t = 4.0000000001, there are no ants on the plank).

Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree - Given a weighted undirected connected graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes ai and bi. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

 

Example 1:

Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:
[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/04/msts.png]
Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/04/ex2.png]


Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

Avoid Flood in The City - Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.

Given an integer array rains where:

 * rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.
 * rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.

Return an array ans where:

 * ans.length == rains.length
 * ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.
 * ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.

If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.

 

Example 1:


Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.


Example 2:


Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].
After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].
It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.

After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.


Example 2:


Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.


Example 3:


Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
Here is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.

A value arr[i] is said to be stronger than a value arr[j] if |arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m| where m is the median of the array.
If |arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|, then arr[i] is said to be stronger than arr[j] if arr[i] > arr[j].

Return a list of the strongest k values in the array. return the answer in any arbitrary order.

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position ((n - 1) / 2) in the sorted list (0-indexed).

 * For arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11], n = 5 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2. The median is 6.
 * For arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3], n = 4 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1. The median is 3.

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [5,1]
Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also accepted answer.
Please note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.


Example 2:


Input: arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2
Output: [5,5]
Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,5,1,1,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 5].

Probability of a Two Boxes Having The Same Number of Distinct Balls - Given 2n balls of k distinct colors. You will be given an integer array balls of size k where balls[i] is the number of balls of color i.

All the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random, then we will distribute the first n balls to the first box and the remaining n balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).

Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).

Return the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

 

Example 1:


Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1


Example 2:


Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667


Example 3:


Input: balls = [1,2,1,2]
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.

You have an empty stack with the two following operations:

 * ""Push"": pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
 * ""Pop"": removes the integer on the top of the stack.

You also have a stream of the integers in the range [1, n].

Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to target. You should follow the following rules:

 * If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
 * If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
 * If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to target, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.

Return the stack operations needed to build target following the mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them.

 

Example 1:


Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: [""Push"",""Push"",""Pop"",""Push""]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].

Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].

Example 2:


Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: [""Push"",""Push"",""Push""]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].

Display Table of Food Orders in a Restaurant - Given the array orders, which represents the orders that customers have done in a restaurant. More specifically orders[i]=[customerNamei,tableNumberi,foodItemi] where customerNamei is the name of the customer, tableNumberi is the table customer sit at, and foodItemi is the item customer orders.

Return the restaurant's “display table”. The “display table” is a table whose row entries denote how many of each food item each table ordered. The first column is the table number and the remaining columns correspond to each food item in alphabetical order. The first row should be a header whose first column is “Table”, followed by the names of the food items. Note that the customer names are not part of the table. Additionally, the rows should be sorted in numerically increasing order.

Example 1:


Input: queries = [3,1,2,1], m = 5
Output: [2,1,2,1] 
Explanation: The queries are processed as follow: 
For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5]. 
For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5]. 
For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5]. 
For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5]. 
Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].

Stone Game III - Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win, or ""Tie"" if they will end the game with the same score.

 

Example 1:


Input: values = [1,2,3,7]
Output: ""Bob""
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.


Example 2:


Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: ""Alice""
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.


Example 3:


Input: values = [1,2,3,6]
Output: ""Tie""
Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.

Design Underground System - An underground railway system is keeping track of customer travel times between different stations. They are using this data to calculate the average time it takes to travel from one station to another.

Implement the UndergroundSystem class:

 * void checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)
   * A customer with a card ID equal to id, checks in at the station stationName at time t.
   * A customer can only be checked into one place at a time.
 * void checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)
   * A customer with a card ID equal to id, checks out from the station stationName at time t.
 * double getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation)
   * Returns the average time it takes to travel from startStation to endStation.
   * The average time is computed from all the previous traveling times from startStation to endStation that happened directly, meaning a check in at startStation followed by a check out from endStation.
   * The time it takes to travel from startStation to endStation may be different from the time it takes to travel from endStation to startStation.
   * There will be at least one customer that has traveled from startStation to endStation before getAverageTime is called.

You may assume all calls to the checkIn and checkOut methods are consistent. If a customer checks in at time t1 then checks out at time t2, then t1 < t2. All events happen in chronological order.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi.

Return the probability that after t seconds the frog is on the vertex target. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Output: 0.16666666666666666 
Explanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666.

The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.

Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place, so team A is the first team.
Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and ranked third by 3 voters.
Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and ranked third by 2 voters.

Tweet Counts Per Frequency - A social media company is trying to monitor activity on their site by analyzing the number of tweets that occur in select periods of time. These periods can be partitioned into smaller time chunks based on a certain frequency (every minute, hour, or day).

For example, the period [10, 10000] (in seconds) would be partitioned into the following time chunks with these frequencies:

 * Every minute (60-second chunks): [10,69], [70,129], [130,189], ..., [9970,10000]
 * Every hour (3600-second chunks): [10,3609], [3610,7209], [7210,10000]
 * Every day (86400-second chunks): [10,10000]

Notice that the last chunk may be shorter than the specified frequency's chunk size and will always end with the end time of the period (10000 in the above example).

Design and implement an API to help the company with their analysis.

Implement the TweetCounts class:

 * TweetCounts() Initializes the TweetCounts object.
 * void recordTweet(String tweetName, int time) Stores the tweetName at the recorded time (in seconds).
 * List<Integer> getTweetCountsPerFrequency(String freq, String tweetName, int startTime, int endTime) Returns a list of integers representing the number of tweets with tweetName in each time chunk for the given period of time [startTime, endTime] (in seconds) and frequency freq.
   * freq is one of ""minute"", ""hour"", or ""day"" representing a frequency of every minute, hour, or day respectively.

Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance - Given the array restaurants where  restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The veganFriendly filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with veganFriendlyi set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters maxPrice and maxDistance which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.

 

Example 1:


Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
Output: [3,1,5] 
Explanation: 
The restaurants are:
Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest).

Explanation: The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.

You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the X-Y plane, where each English uppercase letter is located at some coordinate.

 * For example, the letter 'A' is located at coordinate (0, 0), the letter 'B' is located at coordinate (0, 1), the letter 'P' is located at coordinate (2, 3) and the letter 'Z' is located at coordinate (4, 1).

Given the string word, return the minimum total distance to type such string using only two fingers.

The distance between coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Note that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so do not count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to start at the first letter or the first two letters.

 

Example 1:


Input: word = ""CAKE""

Encrypt and Decrypt Strings - You are given a character array keys containing unique characters and a string array values containing strings of length 2. You are also given another string array dictionary that contains all permitted original strings after decryption. You should implement a data structure that can encrypt or decrypt a 0-indexed string.

A string is encrypted with the following process:

 1. For each character c in the string, we find the index i satisfying keys[i] == c in keys.
 2. Replace c with values[i] in the string.

Note that in case a character of the string is not present in keys, the encryption process cannot be carried out, and an empty string """" is returned.

A string is decrypted with the following process:

 1. For each substring s of length 2 occurring at an even index in the string, we find an i such that values[i] == s. If there are multiple valid i, we choose any one of them. This means a string could have multiple possible strings it can decrypt to.
 2. Replace s with keys[i] in the string.

Implement the Encrypter class:

 * Encrypter(char[] keys, String[] values, String[] dictionary) Initializes the Encrypter class with keys, values, and dictionary.
 * String encrypt(String word1) Encrypts word1 with the encryption process described above and returns the encrypted string.
 * int decrypt(String word2) Returns the number of possible strings word2 could decrypt to that also appear in dictionary.

Explanation: You will be initially given box 0. You will find 7 candies in it and boxes 1 and 2.
Box 1 is closed and you do not have a key for it so you will open box 2. You will find 4 candies and a key to box 1 in box 2.

Minimum Path Cost in a Grid - You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix grid consisting of distinct integers from 0 to m * n - 1. You can move in this matrix from a cell to any other cell in the next row. That is, if you are in cell (x, y) such that x < m - 1, you can move to any of the cells (x + 1, 0), (x + 1, 1), ..., (x + 1, n - 1). Note that it is not possible to move from cells in the last row.

Each possible move has a cost given by a 0-indexed 2D array moveCost of size (m * n) x n, where moveCost[i][j] is the cost of moving from a cell with value i to a cell in column j of the next row. The cost of moving from cells in the last row of grid can be ignored.

Explanation: The path with the minimum possible cost is the path 5 -> 0 -> 1.
- The sum of the values of cells visited is 5 + 0 + 1 = 6.
- The cost of moving from 5 to 0 is 3.
- The cost of moving from 0 to 1 is 8.
So the total cost of the path is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17.

Output: 6
Explanation: The path with the minimum possible cost is the path 2 -> 3.

Calculate Amount Paid in Taxes - You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array brackets where brackets[i] = [upperi, percenti] means that the ith tax bracket has an upper bound of upperi and is taxed at a rate of percenti. The brackets are sorted by upper bound (i.e. upperi-1 < upperi for 0 < i < brackets.length).

Tax is calculated as follows:

 * The first upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent0.
 * The next upper1 - upper0 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent1.
 * The next upper2 - upper1 dollars earned are taxed at a rate of percent2.
 * And so on.

You are given an integer income representing the amount of money you earned. Return the amount of money that you have to pay in taxes. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:


Input: brackets = [[3,50],[7,10],[12,25]], income = 10

The tax rate for the three tax brackets is 50%, 10%, and 25%, respectively.
In total, you pay $3 * 50% + $4 * 10% + $3 * 25% = $2.65 in taxes.


Example 2:


Input: brackets = [[1,0],[4,25],[5,50]], income = 2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation:
Based on your income, you have 1 dollar in the 1st tax bracket and 1 dollar in the 2nd tax bracket.
The tax rate for the two tax brackets is 0% and 25%, respectively.
In total, you pay $1 * 0% + $1 * 25% = $0.25 in taxes.


Example 3:

There is also a 2D array indices where each indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.

For each location indices[i], do both of the following:

 1. Increment all the cells on row ri.
 2. Increment all the cells on column ci.

Given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in indices.

Selling Pieces of Wood - You are given two integers m and n that represent the height and width of a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array prices, where prices[i] = [hi, wi, pricei] indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height hi and width wi for pricei dollars.

To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the entire height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to prices. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you cannot rotate a piece to swap its height and width.

Return the maximum money you can earn after cutting an m x n piece of wood.

Note that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.

Explanation: The diagram above shows a possible scenario. It consists of:
- 2 pieces of wood shaped 2 x 2, selling for a price of 2 * 7 = 14.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 2 x 1, selling for a price of 1 * 3 = 3.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
This obtains a total of 14 + 3 + 2 = 19 money earned.
It can be shown that 19 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.

Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation - Given a callable function f(x, y) with a hidden formula and a value z, reverse engineer the formula and return all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z. You may return the pairs in any order.

While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:

 * f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
 * f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)

The function interface is defined like this:


interface CustomFunction {

We will judge your solution as follows:

 * The judge has a list of 9 hidden implementations of CustomFunction, along with a way to generate an answer key of all valid pairs for a specific z.
 * The judge will receive two inputs: a function_id (to determine which implementation to test your code with), and the target z.
 * The judge will call your findSolution and compare your results with the answer key.

Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams - You are given a 0-indexed string array words, where words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

In one operation, select any index i such that 0 < i < words.length and words[i - 1] and words[i] are anagrams, and delete words[i] from words. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.

Return words after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, ""dacb"" is an anagram of ""abdc"".

 

Example 1:


Input: words = [""abba"",""baba"",""bbaa"",""cd"",""cd""]
Output: [""abba"",""cd""]
Explanation:
One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:
- Since words[2] = ""bbaa"" and words[1] = ""baba"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [""abba"",""baba"",""cd"",""cd""].
- Since words[1] = ""baba"" and words[0] = ""abba"" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words[1].
  Now words = [""abba"",""cd"",""cd""].
- Since words[2] = ""cd"" and words[1] = ""cd"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [""abba"",""cd""].
We can no longer perform any operations, so [""abba"",""cd""] is the final answer.

Example 2:


Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e""]
Output: [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e""]

No two adjacent strings in words are anagrams of each other, so no operations are performed.

- Step 2: Remove the topmost element = 2. The pile becomes [2,4,0,6].
- Step 3: Remove the topmost element = 2. The pile becomes [4,0,6].
- Step 4: Add 5 back onto the pile. The pile becomes [5,4,0,6].

The Dining Philosophers - Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/24/an_illustration_of_the_dining_philosophers_problem.png]

The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem]

 

The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:

 * philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
 * pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
 * eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
 * putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
 * The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 1
Output: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]
Explanation:
n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.
The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:
output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)
- a is the id of a philosopher.

A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.

For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skip_list_add_element-en.gif]

You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

See more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list]

Implement the Skiplist class:

 * Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.
 * bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.
 * void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.
 * bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

Map the number 991 as follows:
1. mapping[9] = 6, so all occurrences of the digit 9 will become 6.
2. mapping[1] = 9, so all occurrences of the digit 1 will become 9.
Therefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669.
338 maps to 007, or 7 after removing the leading zeros.
38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros.
Since 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38.
Thus, the sorted array is [338,38,991].


Example 2:


Input: mapping = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], nums = [789,456,123]
Output: [123,456,789]
Explanation: 789 maps to 789, 456 maps to 456, and 123 maps to 123. Thus, the sorted array is [123,456,789].

You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

 

Example 1:

You will excavate some cells of the grid and remove all the mud from them. If the cell has a part of an artifact buried underneath, it will be uncovered. If all the parts of an artifact are uncovered, you can extract it.

Watering Plants - You want to water n plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i. There is a river at x = -1 that you can refill your watering can at.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:

 * Water the plants in order from left to right.
 * After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.
 * You cannot refill the watering can early.

You are initially at the river (i.e., x = -1). It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.

Given a 0-indexed integer array plants of n integers, where plants[i] is the amount of water the ith plant needs, and an integer capacity representing the watering can capacity, return the number of steps needed to water all the plants.

 

Example 1:


Input: plants = [2,2,3,3], capacity = 5
Output: 14
Explanation: Start at the river with a full watering can:
- Walk to plant 0 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 3 units of water.
- Walk to plant 1 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 1 unit of water.
- Since you cannot completely water plant 2, walk back to the river to refill (2 steps).
- Walk to plant 2 (3 steps) and water it. Watering can has 2 units of water.
- Since you cannot completely water plant 3, walk back to the river to refill (3 steps).
- Walk to plant 3 (4 steps) and water it.
Steps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 14.


Example 2:


Input: plants = [1,1,1,4,2,3], capacity = 4
Output: 30
Explanation: Start at the river with a full watering can:
- Water plants 0, 1, and 2 (3 steps). Return to river (3 steps).
- Water plant 3 (4 steps). Return to river (4 steps).
- Water plant 4 (5 steps). Return to river (5 steps).
- Water plant 5 (6 steps).
Steps needed = 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 30.

Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score - You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer 1 and you want to reach the integer target.

In one move, you can either:

 * Increment the current integer by one (i.e., x = x + 1).
 * Double the current integer (i.e., x = 2 * x).

You can use the increment operation any number of times, however, you can only use the double operation at most maxDoubles times.

Given the two integers target and maxDoubles, return the minimum number of moves needed to reach target starting with 1.

Can Make Palindrome from Substring - You are given a string s and array queries where queries[i] = [lefti, righti, ki]. We may rearrange the substring s[lefti...righti] for each query and then choose up to ki of them to replace with any lowercase English letter.

If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is true. Otherwise, the result is false.

Return a boolean array answer where answer[i] is the result of the ith query queries[i].

Note that each letter is counted individually for replacement, so if, for example s[lefti...righti] = ""aaa"", and ki = 2, we can only replace two of the letters. Also, note that no query modifies the initial string s.

 

Example :


Input: s = ""abcda"", queries = [[3,3,0],[1,2,0],[0,3,1],[0,3,2],[0,4,1]]
Output: [true,false,false,true,true]
Explanation:
queries[0]: substring = ""d"", is palidrome.
queries[1]: substring = ""bc"", is not palidrome.
queries[2]: substring = ""abcd"", is not palidrome after replacing only 1 character.
queries[3]: substring = ""abcd"", could be changed to ""abba"" which is palidrome. Also this can be changed to ""baab"" first rearrange it ""bacd"" then replace ""cd"" with ""ab"".
queries[4]: substring = ""abcda"", could be changed to ""abcba"" which is palidrome.

Rank Transform of a Matrix - Given an m x n matrix, return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col].

The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:

 * The rank is an integer starting from 1.
 * If two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:
   * If p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)
   * If p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)
   * If p > q then rank(p) > rank(q)
 * The rank should be as small as possible.

Explanation:
The rank of matrix[0][0] is 1 because it is the smallest integer in its row and column.
The rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.
The rank of matrix[1][0] is 2 because matrix[1][0] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.
The rank of matrix[1][1] is 3 because matrix[1][1] > matrix[0][1], matrix[1][1] > matrix[1][0], and both matrix[0][1] and matrix[1][0] are rank 2.

Binary Tree Coloring Game - Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree. We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree. n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x. The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player. In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

You are the second player. If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true. If it is not possible, return false.

Graph Connectivity With Threshold - We have n cities labeled from 1 to n. Two different cities with labels x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if x and y share a common divisor strictly greater than some threshold. More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:

 * x % z == 0,
 * y % z == 0, and
 * z > threshold.

Given the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).

Return an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/09/ex1.jpg]


Input: n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
Output: [false,false,true]
Explanation: The divisors for each number:
1:   1
2:   1, 2
3:   1, 3
4:   1, 2, 4
5:   1, 5
6:   1, 2, 3, 6
Using the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the
only ones directly connected. The result of each query:
[1,4]   1 is not connected to 4
[2,5]   2 is not connected to 5
[3,6]   3 is connected to 6 through path 3--6


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/10/tmp.jpg]


Input: n = 6, threshold = 0, queries = [[4,5],[3,4],[3,2],[2,6],[1,3]]
Output: [true,true,true,true,true]
Explanation: The divisors for each number are the same as the previous example. However, since the threshold is 0,
all divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.


Example 3:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/17/ex3.jpg]


Input: n = 5, threshold = 1, queries = [[4,5],[4,5],[3,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: [false,false,false,false,false]
Explanation: Only cities 2 and 4 share a common divisor 2 which is strictly greater than the threshold 1, so they are the only ones directly connected.
Please notice that there can be multiple queries for the same pair of nodes [x, y], and that the query [x, y] is equivalent to the query [y, x].

Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving n + 1 candies to the first person, n + 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give 2 * n candies to the last person.

Brace Expansion II - Under the grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words. Let R(expr) denote the set of words the expression represents.

The grammar can best be understood through simple examples:

 * Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.
   * R(""a"") = {""a""}
   * R(""w"") = {""w""}
 * When we take a comma-delimited list of two or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
   * R(""{a,b,c}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}
   * R(""{{a,b},{b,c}}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)
 * When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.
   * R(""{a,b}{c,d}"") = {""ac"",""ad"",""bc"",""bd""}
   * R(""a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}"") = {""abdfg"", ""abdfh"", ""abefg"", ""abefh"", ""acdfg"", ""acdfh"", ""acefg"", ""acefh""}

Formally, the three rules for our grammar:

 * For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}.
 * For expressions e1, e2, ... , ek with k >= 2, we have R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) ∪ R(e2) ∪ ...
 * For expressions e1 and e2, we have R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) × R(e2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:

 * If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.
 * If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.
The mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).
Since the size of the sample is odd, the median is the middle element 2.
The mode is 1 as it appears the most in the sample.

Moving Stones Until Consecutive II - There are some stones in different positions on the X-axis. You are given an integer array stones, the positions of the stones.

Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position. In one move, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.

 * In particular, if the stones are at say, stones = [1,2,5], you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).

Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String - You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.

We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.

 * For example, if s1 = ""abc"" and s2 = ""cde"", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

 * Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
 * Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
 * Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.

For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = ""abc"" and s2 = ""cde"", ""acd"" and ""aab"" are equivalent strings of baseStr = ""eed"", and ""aab"" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.

 

Example 1:


Input: s1 = ""parker"", s2 = ""morris"", baseStr = ""parser""
Output: ""makkek""
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is ""makkek"".


Example 2:


Input: s1 = ""hello"", s2 = ""world"", baseStr = ""hold""
Output: ""hdld""
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is ""hdld"".


Example 3:


Input: s1 = ""leetcode"", s2 = ""programs"", baseStr = ""sourcecode""
Output: ""aauaaaaada""
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is ""aauaaaaada"".

 * For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

We make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order.

 * For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.

However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. We do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.

Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that 10 * 9 / 8 = 90 / 8 = 11.

Given an integer n, return the clumsy factorial of n.

You are given the root of a maximum binary tree and an integer val.

Just as in the previous problem [https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-tree/], the given tree was constructed from a list a (root = Construct(a)) recursively with the following Construct(a) routine:

 * If a is empty, return null.
 * Otherwise, let a[i] be the largest element of a. Create a root node with the value a[i].
 * The left child of root will be Construct([a[0], a[1], ..., a[i - 1]]).
 * The right child of root will be Construct([a[i + 1], a[i + 2], ..., a[a.length - 1]]).
 * Return root.

Note that we were not given a directly, only a root node root = Construct(a).

Suppose b is a copy of a with the value val appended to it. It is guaranteed that b has unique values.

Return Construct(b).

Odd Even Jump - You are given an integer array arr. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.

You may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:

 * During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
 * During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
 * It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).

Return the number of good starting indices.

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.


Example 2:


Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].
During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].
We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.
In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some
number of jumps.

The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].


Example 2:


Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

Equal Rational Numbers - Given two strings s and t, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return true if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.

A rational number can be represented using up to three parts: <IntegerPart>, <NonRepeatingPart>, and a <RepeatingPart>. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:

 * <IntegerPart>
   * For example, 12, 0, and 123.
 * <IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart>
   * For example, 0.5, 1., 2.12, and 123.0001.

   * Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""YellOw"": correct = ""yellow""
   * Example: wordlist = [""Yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""Yellow""
   * Example: wordlist = [""yellow""], query = ""yellow"": correct = ""yellow""
 * Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.
   * Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yollow"": correct = ""YellOw""
   * Example: wordlist = [""YellOw""], query = ""yeellow"": correct = """" (no match)

 * When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.
 * When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.
 * When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.

For example, with x = 3, we might write 3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3 which is a value of 3.

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:

 * The division operator (/) returns rational numbers.
 * There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
 * We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
 * It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-). For example, ""x - x"" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but ""-x + x"" is not because it uses negation.

Delete Columns to Make Sorted II - You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices answer such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in lexicographic order (i.e., strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2] <= ... <= strs[n - 1]). Return the minimum possible value of answer.length.

 

Example 1:


Input: strs = [""ca"",""bb"",""ac""]

Explanation: 
After deleting the first column, strs = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""].
Now strs is in lexicographic order (ie. strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2]).
We require at least 1 deletion since initially strs was not in lexicographic order, so the answer is 1.


Example 2:


Input: strs = [""xc"",""yb"",""za""]

Explanation: 
strs is already in lexicographic order, so we do not need to delete anything.
Note that the rows of strs are not necessarily in lexicographic order:

Bag of Tokens - You have an initial power of power, an initial score of 0, and a bag of tokens where tokens[i] is the value of the ith token (0-indexed).

Your goal is to maximize your total score by potentially playing each token in one of two ways:

 * If your current power is at least tokens[i], you may play the ith token face up, losing tokens[i] power and gaining 1 score.
 * If your current score is at least 1, you may play the ith token face down, gaining tokens[i] power and losing 1 score.

Each token may be played at most once and in any order. You do not have to play all the tokens.

Return the largest possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.

 

Example 1:


Input: tokens = [100], power = 50
Output: 0
Explanation: Playing the only token in the bag is impossible because you either have too little power or too little score.


Example 2:


Input: tokens = [100,200], power = 150
Output: 1
Explanation: Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 50 and score becomes 1.
There is no need to play the 1st token since you cannot play it face up to add to your score.


Example 3:


Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200
Output: 2
Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:
1. Play the 0th token (100) face up, your power becomes 100 and score becomes 1.
2. Play the 3rd token (400) face down, your power becomes 500 and score becomes 0.

Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column - On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

 

Example 1:


Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.


Example 2:


Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3

1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].
2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

Stamping The Sequence - You are given two strings stamp and target. Initially, there is a string s of length target.length with all s[i] == '?'.

In one turn, you can place stamp over s and replace every letter in the s with the corresponding letter from stamp.

 * For example, if stamp = ""abc"" and target = ""abcba"", then s is ""?????"" initially. In one turn you can:
   * place stamp at index 0 of s to obtain ""abc??"",
   * place stamp at index 1 of s to obtain ""?abc?"", or
   * place stamp at index 2 of s to obtain ""??abc"".

Snakes and Ladders - You are given an n x n integer matrix board where the cells are labeled from 1 to n2 in a Boustrophedon style [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon] starting from the bottom left of the board (i.e. board[n - 1][0]) and alternating direction each row.

You start on square 1 of the board. In each move, starting from square curr, do the following:

 * Choose a destination square next with a label in the range [curr + 1, min(curr + 6, n2)].
   * This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: i.e., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.
 * If next has a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to next.
 * The game ends when you reach the square n2.

A board square on row r and column c has a snake or ladder if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c]. Squares 1 and n2 do not have a snake or ladder.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move. If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.

 * For example, suppose the board is [[-1,4],[-1,3]], and on the first move, your destination square is 2. You follow the ladder to square 3, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to 4.

Return the least number of moves required to reach the square n2. If it is not possible to reach the square, return -1.

Output: 4
Explanation: 
In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).
You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.
You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.

You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

Random Pick with Weight - You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.

You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1] (inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

 * For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%), and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).

 

Example 1:


Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.


Example 2:


Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the ith gas station is positioni miles east of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Example 1:


Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.

Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]

You are also given the helper object Master. You may call Master.guess(word) where word is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from words. Master.guess(word) returns:

 * -1 if word is not from words, or
 * an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.

There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).

For each test case, you should call Master.guess with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:

 * ""Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word."" if you called Master.guess more than allowedGuesses times or if you did not call Master.guess with the secret word, or
 * ""You guessed the secret word correctly."" if you called Master.guess with the secret word with the number of calls to Master.guess less than or equal to allowedGuesses.

The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).

 

Example 1:


Input: secret = ""acckzz"", words = [""acckzz"",""ccbazz"",""eiowzz"",""abcczz""], allowedGuesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation:
master.guess(""aaaaaa"") returns -1, because ""aaaaaa"" is not in wordlist.
master.guess(""acckzz"") returns 6, because ""acckzz"" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess(""ccbazz"") returns 3, because ""ccbazz"" has 3 matches.
master.guess(""eiowzz"") returns 2, because ""eiowzz"" has 2 matches.
master.guess(""abcczz"") returns 4, because ""abcczz"" has 4 matches.

When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.

Find And Replace in String - You are given a 0-indexed string s that you must perform k replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k.

To complete the ith replacement operation:

 1. Check if the substring sources[i] occurs at index indices[i] in the original string s.
 2. If it does not occur, do nothing.
 3. Otherwise if it does occur, replace that substring with targets[i].

For example, if s = ""abcd"", indices[i] = 0, sources[i] = ""ab"", and targets[i] = ""eee"", then the result of this replacement will be ""eeecd"".

All replacement operations must occur simultaneously, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will not overlap.

Design Circular Queue - Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called ""Ring Buffer"".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Implement the MyCircularQueue class:

 * MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.
 * int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
 * int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
 * boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
 * boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
 * boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
 * boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language.

Masking Personal Information - You are given a personal information string s, representing either an email address or a phone number. Return the masked personal information using the below rules.

Email address:

An email address is:

 * A name consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters, followed by
 * The '@' symbol, followed by
 * The domain consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters with a dot '.' somewhere in the middle (not the first or last character).

To mask an email:

 * The uppercase letters in the name and domain must be converted to lowercase letters.
 * The middle letters of the name (i.e., all but the first and last letters) must be replaced by 5 asterisks ""*****"".

Phone number:

A phone number is formatted as follows:

 * The phone number contains 10-13 digits.
 * The last 10 digits make up the local number.
 * The remaining 0-3 digits, in the beginning, make up the country code.
 * Separation characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '} separate the above digits in some way.

To mask a phone number:

 * Remove all separation characters.
 * The masked phone number should have the form:
   * ""***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 0 digits.
   * ""+*-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 1 digit.
   * ""+**-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 2 digits.
   * ""+***-***-***-XXXX"" if the country code has 3 digits.
 * ""XXXX"" is the last 4 digits of the local number.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""LeetCode@LeetCode.com""
Output: ""l*****e@leetcode.com""
Explanation: s is an email address.
The name and domain are converted to lowercase, and the middle of the name is replaced by 5 asterisks.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""AB@qq.com""
Output: ""a*****b@qq.com""
Explanation: s is an email address.
The name and domain are converted to lowercase, and the middle of the name is replaced by 5 asterisks.
Note that even though ""ab"" is 2 characters, it still must have 5 asterisks in the middle.


Example 3:


Input: s = ""1(234)567-890""
Output: ""***-***-7890""
Explanation: s is a phone number.
There are 10 digits, so the local number is 10 digits and the country code is 0 digits.
Thus, the resulting masked number is ""***-***-7890"".

 * age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
 * age[y] > age[x]
 * age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100

Otherwise, x will send a friend request to y.

Note that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.

Return the total number of friend requests made.

 

Example 1:


Input: ages = [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.


Example 2:


Input: ages = [16,17,18]

 * ""hello"" -> ""heeellooo""
 * ""hi"" -> ""hiiii""

In these strings like ""heeellooo"", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: ""h"", ""eee"", ""ll"", ""ooo"".

You are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is three or more.

 * For example, starting with ""hello"", we could do an extension on the group ""o"" to get ""hellooo"", but we cannot get ""helloo"" since the group ""oo"" has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like ""ll"" -> ""lllll"" to get ""helllllooo"". If s = ""helllllooo"", then the query word ""hello"" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = ""hello"" -> ""hellooo"" -> ""helllllooo"" = s.

Return the number of query strings that are stretchy.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""heeellooo"", words = [""hello"", ""hi"", ""helo""]

Explanation: 
We can extend ""e"" and ""o"" in the word ""hello"" to get ""heeellooo"".

 1. Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B,
 2. Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B,
 3. Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B, and
 4. Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B.

When we serve some soup, we give it to someone, and we no longer have it. Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with an equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as possible. We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

Note that we do not have an operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first.

Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Output: 0.62500
Explanation: If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first.
For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
For the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

 * It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or

You are also given an array hits, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location hits[i] = (rowi, coli). The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the grid (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).

We erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:

We erase the underlined brick at (1,1), resulting in the grid:

 [1,0,0,0]]
All remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall. The grid remains the same:
[[1,0,0,0],

Next, we erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:

Find Eventual Safe States - There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.

Champagne Tower - We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.

 * For example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

 * val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
 * isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

Quad-Tree format:

The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].

If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.

Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |

The serialization of each level is as follows:


[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]


To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

Pyramid Transition Matrix - You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains one less block than the row beneath it and is centered on top.

To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.

 * For example, ""ABC"" represents a triangular pattern with a 'C' block stacked on top of an 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) block. Note that this is different from ""BAC"" where 'B' is on the left bottom and 'A' is on the right bottom.

You start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid.

Cracking the Safe - There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].

The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.

 * For example, the correct password is ""345"" and you enter in ""012345"":
   * After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is ""0"", which is incorrect.

Open the Lock - You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Note that a sequence like ""0000"" -> ""0001"" -> ""0002"" -> ""0102"" -> ""0202"" would be invalid,

A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in licensePlate. Ignore numbers and spaces in licensePlate, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in licensePlate, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.

For example, if licensePlate = ""aBc 12c"", then it contains letters 'a', 'b' (ignoring case), and 'c' twice. Possible completing words are ""abccdef"", ""caaacab"", and ""cbca"".

Parse Lisp Expression - You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.

The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

 * An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
 * (An integer could be positive or negative.)
 * A let expression takes the form ""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.
 * An add expression takes the form ""(add e1 e2)"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
 * A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e1 e2)"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
 * For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
 * Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.

 

Example 1:


Input: expression = ""(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))""
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.


Example 2:


Input: expression = ""(let x 3 x 2 x)""
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.


Example 3:


Input: expression = ""(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))""

The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on.

Remove Comments - Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

 * The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
 * The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others.

 * For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
 * Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.

 * For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.

Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.

It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.

After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.

 

Example 1:

int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for

a = b + c;

Example 2:

Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.

After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:

 * Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
 * Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.

Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be ""Radiant"" or ""Dire"".

Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...
'Z' -> ""26""


To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, ""11106"" can be mapped into:

 * ""AAJF"" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
 * ""KJF"" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because ""06"" cannot be mapped into 'F' since ""6"" is different from ""06"".

In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message ""1*"" may represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"". Decoding ""1*"" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.

Given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""*""

Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", or ""9"".
Each of these can be decoded to the strings ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H"", and ""I"" respectively.
Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode ""*"".


Example 2:


Input: s = ""1*""
Output: 18
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"".
Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. ""11"" can be decoded to ""AA"" or ""K"").
Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode ""1*"".


Example 3:


Input: s = ""2*""

Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", ""26"", ""27"", ""28"", or ""29"".
""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", and ""26"" have 2 ways of being decoded, but ""27"", ""28"", and ""29"" only have 1 way.

Exclusive Time of Functions - On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.

Function calls are stored in a call stack [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack]: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.

A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.

Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.

Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.

Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]

visit_date is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
No two rows will have the same visit_date, and as the id increases, the dates increase as well.


 

Write an SQL query to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive id's, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:

 1. The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
 2. A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
 3. A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
 4. A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
 5. A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
 6. A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
 7. The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
 8. CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.

 

Example 1:


Input: code = ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.


Example 2:


Input: code = ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""
The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:

 1. You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the ""12:00"" direction, where this character must equal key[i].
 2. If the character key[i] has been aligned at the ""12:00"" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

In this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand.

Your goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn:

 * Pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
 * If there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.
   * If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
 * If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
 * Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.

Given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board.

Example 1:


Input: board = ""WRRBBW"", hand = ""RB""
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.
There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.

Example 2:

Explanation: To make the board empty:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,5,2]

Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.

 * int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
 * void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.

When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.

To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.

You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

 1. Choose some live pigs to feed.
 2. For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
 3. Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
 4. After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
 5. Repeat this process until you run out of time.

- If only the second pig dies, then bucket 3 must be poisonous.
- If both pigs die, then bucket 2 must be poisonous.
- If neither pig dies, then bucket 4 must be poisonous.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

 

Example 1:


Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].


Example 2:


Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.


Example 3:

 * For example, the below binary watch reads ""4:51"".

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/binarywatch.jpg]

Given an integer turnedOn which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on (ignoring the PM), return all possible times the watch could represent. You may return the answer in any order.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

 * For example, ""01:00"" is not valid. It should be ""1:00"".

The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

 * For example, ""10:2"" is not valid. It should be ""10:02"".

UTF-8 Validation - Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

 1. For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
 2. For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:


     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)

x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.

Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

 

Example 1:


Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.

Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

Longest Absolute File Path - Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mdir.jpg]

Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.

In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):


dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext

Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

 * For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
 * In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

Example 1:


Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.


 

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The query result format is in the following example.

Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.


 

Write an SQL query to rank the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

 * The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
 * If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
 * After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.

Dungeon Game - The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.

Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

 2. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
 3. It repeats until no input elements remain.

Search in Rotated Sorted Array II - There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II - Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm] such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm] with O(1) extra memory.

The judge will test your solution with the following code:


int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


Example 2:


Input: x = -121

String to Integer (atoi) - Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

 1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
 2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
 3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
 4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
 5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
 6. Return the integer as the final result.

Note:

 * Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
 * Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.


Example 3:


Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.
