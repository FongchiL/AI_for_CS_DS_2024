 * If one element exists, add its value to the concatenation value of nums, then delete it.

Return the concatenation value of the nums.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [7,52,2,4]
Output: 596
Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [7,52,2,4] and concatenation value is 0.
 - In the first operation:
We pick the first element, 7, and the last element, 4.
Their concatenation is 74, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 74.
Then we delete them from nums, so nums becomes equal to [52,2].
 - In the second operation:
We pick the first element, 52, and the last element, 2.
Their concatenation is 522, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 596.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes empty.
Since the concatenation value is 596 so the answer is 596.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [5,14,13,8,12]
Output: 673
Explanation: Before performing any operation, nums is [5,14,13,8,12] and concatenation value is 0.
 - In the first operation:
We pick the first element, 5, and the last element, 12.
Their concatenation is 512, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 512.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [14,13,8].
 - In the second operation:
We pick the first element, 14, and the last element, 8.
Their concatenation is 148, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 660.
Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [13].
 - In the third operation:
nums has only one element, so we pick 13 and add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 673.
Then we delete it from nums, so nums become empty.
Since the concatenation value is 673 so the answer is 673.

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several guesses about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

 * Chooses two distinct integers u and v such that there exists an edge [u, v] in the tree.
 * He tells Alice that u is the parent of v in the tree.

Bob's guesses are represented by a 2D integer array guesses where guesses[j] = [uj, vj] indicates Bob guessed uj to be the parent of vj.

Time to Cross a Bridge - There are k workers who want to move n boxes from an old warehouse to a new one. You are given the two integers n and k, and a 2D integer array time of size k x 4 where time[i] = [leftToRighti, pickOldi, rightToLefti, putNewi].

The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. The old warehouse is on the right bank of the river, and the new warehouse is on the left bank of the river. Initially, all k workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the ith worker (0-indexed) can :

 * Cross the bridge from the left bank (new warehouse) to the right bank (old warehouse) in leftToRighti minutes.
 * Pick a box from the old warehouse and return to the bridge in pickOldi minutes. Different workers can pick up their boxes simultaneously.
 * Cross the bridge from the right bank (old warehouse) to the left bank (new warehouse) in rightToLefti minutes.
 * Put the box in the new warehouse and return to the bridge in putNewi minutes. Different workers can put their boxes simultaneously.

A worker i is less efficient than a worker j if either condition is met:

 * leftToRighti + rightToLefti > leftToRightj + rightToLeftj
 * leftToRighti + rightToLefti == leftToRightj + rightToLeftj and i > j

The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge :

 * If a worker x reaches the bridge while another worker y is crossing the bridge, x waits at their side of the bridge.
 * If the bridge is free, the worker waiting on the right side of the bridge gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the right side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.
 * If the bridge is free and no worker is waiting on the right side, and at least one box remains at the old warehouse, the worker on the left side of the river gets to cross the bridge. If more than one worker is waiting on the left side, the one with the lowest efficiency crosses first.

Return the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left bank of the river after all n boxes have been put in the new warehouse.

 

Example 1:

From 1 to 2: worker 2 picks up a box from the old warehouse.
From 2 to 6: worker 2 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left bank.
From 6 to 7: worker 2 puts a box at the new warehouse.
The whole process ends after 7 minutes. We return 6 because the problem asks for the instance of time at which the last worker reaches the left bank.

From 30 to 40: worker 1 puts a box at the new warehouse.
From 30 to 31: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left bank.
From 31 to 39: worker 0 puts a box at the new warehouse.
From 39 to 40: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the left bank to the right bank.
From 40 to 49: worker 0 picks up a box from the old warehouse.
From 49 to 50: worker 0 crosses the bridge from the right bank to the left bank.

Output: 12
Explanation: 
The four possible subsequence scores are:
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
- We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12.

Maximize the Minimum Powered City - You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.

 * Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.

The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.

The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.

Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.

Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.

 

Example 1:


Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
So the minimum power of a city is 5.
Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.

 * the price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,
 * the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.

The game goes on as follows:

 * Initially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.
 * At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.
 * For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:
   * If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
   * If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is c, both of them receive c / 2 each.
 * If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node 0, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.

The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.

Minimum Total Distance Traveled - There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer array robot where robot[i] is the position of the ith robot. You are also given a 2D integer array factory where factory[j] = [positionj, limitj] indicates that positionj is the position of the jth factory and that the jth factory can repair at most limitj robots.

The positions of each robot are unique. The positions of each factory are also unique. Note that a robot can be in the same position as a factory initially.

All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving.

At any moment, you can set the initial direction of moving for some robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.

Return the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots. The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired.

Note that

 * All robots move at the same speed.
 * If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.
 * If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.
 * If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.
 * If the robot moved from a position x to a position y, the distance it moved is |y - x|.

- The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
- The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.
- The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.
The limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.
The limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.

 * You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
 * In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
   * For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
   * In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.

Explanation: We do the following operations:
- i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].
- i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
- i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].

Example 1:


Input: queries = [""word"",""note"",""ants"",""wood""], dictionary = [""wood"",""joke"",""moat""]
Output: [""word"",""note"",""wood""]
Explanation:
- Changing the 'r' in ""word"" to 'o' allows it to equal the dictionary word ""wood"".
- Changing the 'n' to 'j' and the 't' to 'k' in ""note"" changes it to ""joke"".
- It would take more than 2 edits for ""ants"" to equal a dictionary word.

- players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.
- players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 <= 8.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.


Example 2:


Input: players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players.
Each player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1.

- ""abc"" has 3 prefixes: ""a"", ""ab"", and ""abc"".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix ""a"", 2 strings with the prefix ""ab"", and 1 string with the prefix ""abc"".
The total is answer[0] = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.
- ""ab"" has 2 prefixes: ""a"" and ""ab"".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix ""a"", and 2 strings with the prefix ""ab"".
The total is answer[1] = 2 + 2 = 4.
- ""bc"" has 2 prefixes: ""b"" and ""bc"".
- There are 2 strings with the prefix ""b"", and 1 string with the prefix ""bc"".

Explanation: One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above.
We choose s = {0, 2}.
- Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1.
- Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s.
- Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s.
- Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s.

Output: true
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance[0] = 1.
- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance[1] = 3.
- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance[2] = 0.
Note that distance[3] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.
Return true because s is a well-spaced string.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""aa"", distance = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: false
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.
Because distance[0] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.

The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.

You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.

The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

 * The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.
 * The number lefti should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number righti appears for all i from 0 to m - 1.

Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
The row conditions are the following:
- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
The column conditions are the following:
- Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
Note that there may be multiple correct answers.

Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage - You are given a 0-indexed array of strings garbage where garbage[i] represents the assortment of garbage at the ith house. garbage[i] consists only of the characters 'M', 'P' and 'G' representing one unit of metal, paper and glass garbage respectively. Picking up one unit of any type of garbage takes 1 minute.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array travel where travel[i] is the number of minutes needed to go from house i to house i + 1.

There are three garbage trucks in the city, each responsible for picking up one type of garbage. Each garbage truck starts at house 0 and must visit each house in order; however, they do not need to visit every house.

Only one garbage truck may be used at any given moment. While one truck is driving or picking up garbage, the other two trucks cannot do anything.

Return the minimum number of minutes needed to pick up all the garbage.

 

Example 1:


Input: garbage = [""G"",""P"",""GP"",""GG""], travel = [2,4,3]

Explanation:
The paper garbage truck:
1. Travels from house 0 to house 1
2. Collects the paper garbage at house 1
3. Travels from house 1 to house 2
4. Collects the paper garbage at house 2
Altogether, it takes 8 minutes to pick up all the paper garbage.
The glass garbage truck:
1. Collects the glass garbage at house 0
2. Travels from house 0 to house 1
3. Travels from house 1 to house 2
4. Collects the glass garbage at house 2
5. Travels from house 2 to house 3
6. Collects the glass garbage at house 3
Altogether, it takes 13 minutes to pick up all the glass garbage.
Since there is no metal garbage, we do not need to consider the metal garbage truck.
Therefore, it takes a total of 8 + 13 = 21 minutes to collect all the garbage.


Example 2:


Input: garbage = [""MMM"",""PGM"",""GP""], travel = [3,10]

A pair of numbers (num1, num2) is called excellent if the following conditions are satisfied:

 * Both the numbers num1 and num2 exist in the array nums.
 * The sum of the number of set bits in num1 OR num2 and num1 AND num2 is greater than or equal to k, where OR is the bitwise OR operation and AND is the bitwise AND operation.

Explanation: The excellent pairs are the following:
- (3, 3). (3 AND 3) and (3 OR 3) are both equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than or equal to k = 3.
- (2, 3) and (3, 2). (2 AND 3) is equal to (10) in binary, and (2 OR 3) is equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 1 + 2 = 3.
- (1, 3) and (3, 1). (1 AND 3) is equal to (01) in binary, and (1 OR 3) is equal to (11) in binary. The total number of set bits is 1 + 2 = 3.

Return the minimum sum of squared difference after modifying array nums1 at most k1 times and modifying array nums2 at most k2 times.

Note: You are allowed to modify the array elements to become negative integers.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4], nums2 = [2,10,20,19], k1 = 0, k2 = 0
Output: 579
Explanation: The elements in nums1 and nums2 cannot be modified because k1 = 0 and k2 = 0. 
The sum of square difference will be: (1 - 2)2 + (2 - 10)2 + (3 - 20)2 + (4 - 19)2 = 579.


Example 2:


Input: nums1 = [1,4,10,12], nums2 = [5,8,6,9], k1 = 1, k2 = 1
Output: 43
Explanation: One way to obtain the minimum sum of square difference is: 
- Increase nums1[0] once.
- Increase nums2[2] once.
The minimum of the sum of square difference will be: 
(2 - 5)2 + (4 - 8)2 + (10 - 7)2 + (12 - 9)2 = 43.
Note that, there are other ways to obtain the minimum of the sum of square difference, but there is no way to obtain a sum smaller than 43.

The Latest Time to Catch a Bus - You are given a 0-indexed integer array buses of length n, where buses[i] represents the departure time of the ith bus. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array passengers of length m, where passengers[j] represents the arrival time of the jth passenger. All bus departure times are unique. All passenger arrival times are unique.

You are given an integer capacity, which represents the maximum number of passengers that can get on each bus.

When a passenger arrives, they will wait in line for the next available bus. You can get on a bus that departs at x minutes if you arrive at y minutes where y <= x, and the bus is not full. Passengers with the earliest arrival times get on the bus first.

More formally when a bus arrives, either:

 * If capacity or fewer passengers are waiting for a bus, they will all get on the bus, or
 * The capacity passengers with the earliest arrival times will get on the bus.

Return the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus. You cannot arrive at the same time as another passenger.

Note: The arrays buses and passengers are not necessarily sorted.

 

Example 1:


Input: buses = [10,20], passengers = [2,17,18,19], capacity = 2

Explanation: Suppose you arrive at time 16.
At time 10, the first bus departs with the 0th passenger. 
At time 20, the second bus departs with you and the 1st passenger.
Note that you may not arrive at the same time as another passenger, which is why you must arrive before the 1st passenger to catch the bus.

Example 2:


Input: buses = [20,30,10], passengers = [19,13,26,4,25,11,21], capacity = 2

Example 1:


Input: start = ""_L__R__R_"", target = ""L______RR""

Explanation: We can obtain the string target from start by doing the following moves:
- Move the first piece one step to the left, start becomes equal to ""L___R__R_"".
- Move the last piece one step to the right, start becomes equal to ""L___R___R"".
- Move the second piece three steps to the right, start becomes equal to ""L______RR"".
Since it is possible to get the string target from start, we return true.


Example 2:


Input: start = ""R_L_"", target = ""__LR""

Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree - There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:

 1. Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
 2. The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.

 * For example, say the three components have the node values: [4,5,7], [1,9], and [3,3,3]. The three XOR values are 4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = 6, 1 ^ 9 = 8, and 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3. The largest XOR value is 8 and the smallest XOR value is 3. The score is then 8 - 3 = 5.

Return the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: 9
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
- The 2nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
- The 3rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.

Booking Concert Tickets in Groups - A concert hall has n rows numbered from 0 to n - 1, each with m seats, numbered from 0 to m - 1. You need to design a ticketing system that can allocate seats in the following cases:

 * If a group of k spectators can sit together in a row.
 * If every member of a group of k spectators can get a seat. They may or may not sit together.

Note that the spectators are very picky. Hence:

 * They will book seats only if each member of their group can get a seat with row number less than or equal to maxRow. maxRow can vary from group to group.
 * In case there are multiple rows to choose from, the row with the smallest number is chosen. If there are multiple seats to choose in the same row, the seat with the smallest number is chosen.

Implement the BookMyShow class:

 * BookMyShow(int n, int m) Initializes the object with n as number of rows and m as number of seats per row.
 * int[] gather(int k, int maxRow) Returns an array of length 2 denoting the row and seat number (respectively) of the first seat being allocated to the k members of the group, who must sit together. In other words, it returns the smallest possible r and c such that all [c, c + k - 1] seats are valid and empty in row r, and r <= maxRow. Returns [] in case it is not possible to allocate seats to the group.
 * boolean scatter(int k, int maxRow) Returns true if all k members of the group can be allocated seats in rows 0 to maxRow, who may or may not sit together. If the seats can be allocated, it allocates k seats to the group with the smallest row numbers, and the smallest possible seat numbers in each row. Otherwise, returns false.

A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:

 1. Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
 2. Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, ""346"" is replaced with ""13"" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
 3. Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.

Return s after all rounds have been completed.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""11111222223"", k = 3
Output: ""135""
Explanation: 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: ""111"", ""112"", ""222"", and ""23"".
  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
  So, s becomes ""3"" + ""4"" + ""6"" + ""5"" = ""3465"" after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into ""346"" and ""5"".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
  So, s becomes ""13"" + ""5"" = ""135"" after second round. 
Now, s.length <= k, so we return ""135"" as the answer.

Design an ATM Machine - There is an ATM machine that stores banknotes of 5 denominations: 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 dollars. Initially the ATM is empty. The user can use the machine to deposit or withdraw any amount of money.

When withdrawing, the machine prioritizes using banknotes of larger values.

 * For example, if you want to withdraw $300 and there are 2 $50 banknotes, 1 $100 banknote, and 1 $200 banknote, then the machine will use the $100 and $200 banknotes.
 * However, if you try to withdraw $600 and there are 3 $200 banknotes and 1 $500 banknote, then the withdraw request will be rejected because the machine will first try to use the $500 banknote and then be unable to use banknotes to complete the remaining $100. Note that the machine is not allowed to use the $200 banknotes instead of the $500 banknote.

Implement the ATM class:

 * ATM() Initializes the ATM object.
 * void deposit(int[] banknotesCount) Deposits new banknotes in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500.
 * int[] withdraw(int amount) Returns an array of length 5 of the number of banknotes that will be handed to the user in the order $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500, and update the number of banknotes in the ATM after withdrawing. Returns [-1] if it is not possible (do not withdraw any banknotes in this case).

In order to add a letter, Alice has to press the key of the corresponding digit i times, where i is the position of the letter in the key.

 * For example, to add the letter 's', Alice has to press '7' four times. Similarly, to add the letter 'k', Alice has to press '5' twice.
 * Note that the digits '0' and '1' do not map to any letters, so Alice does not use them.

However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a string of pressed keys instead.

 * For example, when Alice sent the message ""bob"", Bob received the string ""2266622"".

Given a string pressedKeys representing the string received by Bob, return the total number of possible text messages Alice could have sent.

The 11 distinct subarrays which have at most k = 2 elements divisible by 2 are:
[2], [2,3], [2,3,3], [2,3,3,2], [3], [3,3], [3,3,2], [3,3,2,2], [3,2], [3,2,2], and [2,2].
Note that the subarrays [2] and [3] occur more than once in nums, but they should each be counted only once.
The subarray [2,3,3,2,2] should not be counted because it has 3 elements that are divisible by 2.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 4, p = 1
Output: 10
Explanation:
All element of nums are divisible by p = 1.
Also, every subarray of nums will have at most 4 elements that are divisible by 1.
Since all subarrays are distinct, the total number of subarrays satisfying all the constraints is 10.


 

Constraints:

 * 1 <= nums.length <= 200
 * 1 <= nums[i], p <= 200

You are given a 0-indexed integer array flowers of size n, where flowers[i] is the number of flowers already planted in the ith garden. Flowers that are already planted cannot be removed. You are then given another integer newFlowers, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers target, full, and partial.

A garden is considered complete if it has at least target flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:

 * The number of complete gardens multiplied by full.
 * The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by partial. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be 0.

Return the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most newFlowers flowers.

 

Example 1:


Input: flowers = [1,3,1,1], newFlowers = 7, target = 6, full = 12, partial = 1

Explanation: Alice can plant
- 2 flowers in the 0th garden
- 3 flowers in the 1st garden
- 1 flower in the 2nd garden
- 1 flower in the 3rd garden

You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti] denotes that there exists a directed edge from fromi to toi with weight weighti.

Lastly, you are given three distinct integers src1, src2, and dest denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return the minimum weight of a subgraph of the graph such that it is possible to reach dest from both src1 and src2 via a set of edges of this subgraph. In case such a subgraph does not exist, return -1.

A subgraph is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of the original graph. The weight of a subgraph is the sum of weights of its constituent edges.

Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array - You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and two integers key and k. A k-distant index is an index i of nums for which there exists at least one index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key.

Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.
- For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.

Maximum Points in an Archery Competition - Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:

 1. Alice first shoots numArrows arrows and then Bob shoots numArrows arrows.
 2. The points are then calculated as follows:
    1. The target has integer scoring sections ranging from 0 to 11 inclusive.
    2. For each section of the target with score k (in between 0 to 11), say Alice and Bob have shot ak and bk arrows on that section respectively. If ak >= bk, then Alice takes k points. If ak < bk, then Bob takes k points.
    3. However, if ak == bk == 0, then nobody takes k points.

 * For example, if Alice and Bob both shot 2 arrows on the section with score 11, then Alice takes 11 points. On the other hand, if Alice shot 0 arrows on the section with score 11 and Bob shot 2 arrows on that same section, then Bob takes 11 points.

You are given the integer numArrows and an integer array aliceArrows of size 12, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. Now, Bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain.

Return the array bobArrows which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on each scoring section from 0 to 11. The sum of the values in bobArrows should equal numArrows.

You are given a 0-indexed string directions of length n. directions[i] can be either 'L', 'R', or 'S' denoting whether the ith car is moving towards the left, towards the right, or staying at its current point respectively. Each moving car has the same speed.

The number of collisions can be calculated as follows:

 * When two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by 2.
 * When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by 1.

After a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.

Return the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.

 

Example 1:


Input: directions = ""RLRSLL""
Output: 5
Explanation:
The collisions that will happen on the road are:
- Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.
- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.
- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.
Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5.

Construct a new string repeatLimitedString using the characters of s such that no letter appears more than repeatLimit times in a row. You do not have to use all characters from s.

Return the lexicographically largest repeatLimitedString possible.

A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. If the first min(a.length, b.length) characters do not differ, then the longer string is the lexicographically larger one.

 

Example 1:

In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2.

 * For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4. However, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1.

Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.

 

Example 1:


Input: num1 = 2, num2 = 3

Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 2, num2 = 3. Since num1 < num2, we subtract num1 from num2 and get num1 = 2, num2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
- Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
- Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1.

Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods - You are given a 0-indexed binary string s which represents a sequence of train cars. s[i] = '0' denotes that the ith car does not contain illegal goods and s[i] = '1' denotes that the ith car does contain illegal goods.

As the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods. You can do any of the following three operations any number of times:

 1. Remove a train car from the left end (i.e., remove s[0]) which takes 1 unit of time.
 2. Remove a train car from the right end (i.e., remove s[s.length - 1]) which takes 1 unit of time.
 3. Remove a train car from anywhere in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.

Return the minimum time to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.

Note that an empty sequence of cars is considered to have no cars containing illegal goods.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""1100101""
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end. Time taken is 1.
- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.
This obtains a total time of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. 

An alternative way is to
- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end 3 times. Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
This also obtains a total time of 2 + 3 = 5.

5 is the minimum time taken to remove all the cars containing illegal goods. 
There are no other ways to remove them with less time.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""0010""
Output: 2
Explanation:
One way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove a car from the left end 3 times. Time taken is 3 * 1 = 3.
This obtains a total time of 3.

Another way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to
- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.
This obtains a total time of 2.

Another way to remove all the cars containing illegal goods from the sequence is to 
- remove a car from the right end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2. 
This obtains a total time of 2.

2 is the minimum time taken to remove all the cars containing illegal goods.

 * void unfix(int idx) Updates the value of the bit at the index idx to 0. If the value was already 0, no change occurs.
 * void flip() Flips the values of each bit in the Bitset. In other words, all bits with value 0 will now have value 1 and vice versa.
 * boolean all() Checks if the value of each bit in the Bitset is 1. Returns true if it satisfies the condition, false otherwise.

 1. Sort the values at odd indices of nums in non-increasing order.
    * For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [4,3,2,1] after. The values at odd indices 1 and 3 are sorted in non-increasing order.
 2. Sort the values at even indices of nums in non-decreasing order.
    * For example, if nums = [4,1,2,3] before this step, it becomes [2,1,4,3] after. The values at even indices 0 and 2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Return the array formed after rearranging the values of nums.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [4,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3,4,1]
Explanation: 
First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1].
Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order.
So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].
Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].


Example 2:


Input: nums = [2,1]
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: 
Since there is exactly one odd index and one even index, no rearrangement of values takes place.
The resultant array formed is [2,1], which is the same as the initial array.

The array words can be divided into one or more non-intersecting groups. A string belongs to a group if any one of the following is true:

 * It is connected to at least one other string of the group.
 * It is the only string present in the group.

Note that the strings in words should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.

Explanation:
- words[0] can be used to obtain words[1] (by replacing 'a' with 'b'), and words[2] (by adding 'b'). So words[0] is connected to words[1] and words[2].
- words[1] can be used to obtain words[0] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words[2] (by adding 'a'). So words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].

Rearrange Array Elements by Sign - You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should rearrange the elements of nums such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

 1. Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.
 2. For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.
 3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.

Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements - You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.

You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:

 * The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
 * The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.

The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.

 * For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
 * Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.

Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 


Example 2:


Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.

 * at least 1 second.
 * at most 99 minutes and 99 seconds.

To set the cooking time, you push at most four digits. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes. It interprets the first two digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. It then adds them up as the cooking time. For example,

 * You push 9 5 4 (three digits). It is normalized as 0954 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 54 seconds.

Divide a String Into Groups of Size k - A string s can be partitioned into groups of size k using the following procedure:

 * The first group consists of the first k characters of the string, the second group consists of the next k characters of the string, and so on. Each character can be a part of exactly one group.
 * For the last group, if the string does not have k characters remaining, a character fill is used to complete the group.

Note that the partition is done so that after removing the fill character from the last group (if it exists) and concatenating all the groups in order, the resultant string should be s.

Given the string s, the size of each group k and the character fill, return a string array denoting the composition of every group s has been divided into, using the above procedure.

Explanation:
The first 3 characters ""abc"" form the first group.
The next 3 characters ""def"" form the second group.
The last 3 characters ""ghi"" form the third group.
Since all groups can be completely filled by characters from the string, we do not need to use fill.

Count Words Obtained After Adding a Letter - You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings startWords and targetWords. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.

For each string in targetWords, check if it is possible to choose a string from startWords and perform a conversion operation on it to be equal to that from targetWords.

The conversion operation is described in the following two steps:

 1. Append any lowercase letter that is not present in the string to its end.
    * For example, if the string is ""abc"", the letters 'd', 'e', or 'y' can be added to it, but not 'a'. If 'd' is added, the resulting string will be ""abcd"".
 2. Rearrange the letters of the new string in any arbitrary order.
    * For example, ""abcd"" can be rearranged to ""acbd"", ""bacd"", ""cbda"", and so on. Note that it can also be rearranged to ""abcd"" itself.

Return the number of strings in targetWords that can be obtained by performing the operations on any string of startWords.

Note that you will only be verifying if the string in targetWords can be obtained from a string in startWords by performing the operations. The strings in startWords do not actually change during this process.

 

Example 1:


Input: startWords = [""ant"",""act"",""tack""], targetWords = [""tack"",""act"",""acti""]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- In order to form targetWords[0] = ""tack"", we use startWords[1] = ""act"", append 'k' to it, and rearrange ""actk"" to ""tack"".
- There is no string in startWords that can be used to obtain targetWords[1] = ""act"".
  Note that ""act"" does exist in startWords, but we must append one letter to the string before rearranging it.
- In order to form targetWords[2] = ""acti"", we use startWords[1] = ""act"", append 'i' to it, and rearrange ""acti"" to ""acti"" itself.


Example 2:


Input: startWords = [""ab"",""a""], targetWords = [""abc"",""abcd""]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- In order to form targetWords[0] = ""abc"", we use startWords[0] = ""ab"", add 'c' to it, and rearrange it to ""abc"".

The integers in the grid represent the following:

 * 0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
 * 1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
 * All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely move to and from these item cells.

It takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells.

You are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low, high] and start = [row, col] indicates that you start at the position (row, col) and are interested only in items with a price in the range of [low, high] (inclusive). You are further given an integer k.

You are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices are within the given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different:

 1. Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter distance has a higher rank).
 2. Price (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).
 3. The row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).
 4. The column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).

Return the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to lowest). If there are fewer than k reachable items within the price range, return all of them.

Explanation: You start at (0,0).
With a price range of [2,5], we can take items from (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) and (2,2).
The ranks of these items are:
- (0,1) with distance 1
- (1,1) with distance 2

Example 1:


Input: cost = [1,2,3]

Explanation: We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the only way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.


Example 2:

- Buy candies with costs 9 and 7
- Take the candy with cost 6 for free
- We buy candies with costs 5 and 2
- Take the last remaining candy with cost 2 for free
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 9 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 23.

Return true if all asteroids can be destroyed. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:


Input: mass = 10, asteroids = [3,9,19,5,21]

Explanation: One way to order the asteroids is [9,19,5,3,21]:
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 9. New planet mass: 10 + 9 = 19
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 19. New planet mass: 19 + 19 = 38
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 5. New planet mass: 38 + 5 = 43
- The planet collides with the asteroid with a mass of 3. New planet mass: 43 + 3 = 46

 1. lower[i] = arr[i] - k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n
 2. higher[i] = arr[i] + k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.

Given an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher, return the original array arr. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.

Note: The test cases are generated such that there exists at least one valid array arr.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
Output: [3,7,11]
Explanation:
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.
Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. 


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,1,3,3]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].
Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.
Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.
This is invalid since k must be positive.


Example 3:


Input: nums = [5,435]
Output: [220]
Explanation:
The only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215. Using them, we get lower = [5] and higher = [435].

Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing - You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.

The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.

 * For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:
   * arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
   * arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
   * arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
   * arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)
 * However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).

In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1

Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.


Example 2:


Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.

Example 3:


Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.

Watering Plants II - Alice and Bob want to water n plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where the ith plant is located at x = i.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:

 * Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the 0th plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the (n - 1)th plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.
 * It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.
 * Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.
 * In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.

Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.
- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.

Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.
- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.

Sum of Subarray Ranges - You are given an integer array nums. The range of a subarray of nums is the difference between the largest and smallest element in the subarray.

Return the sum of all subarray ranges of nums.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0 
[2], range = 2 - 2 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,2], range = 2 - 1 = 1
[2,3], range = 3 - 2 = 1
[1,2,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 6 subarrays of nums are the following:
[1], range = largest - smallest = 1 - 1 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
[3,3], range = 3 - 3 = 0
[1,3,3], range = 3 - 1 = 2
So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.

You are given a string rings of length 2n that describes the n rings that are placed onto the rods. Every two characters in rings forms a color-position pair that is used to describe each ring where:

 * The first character of the ith pair denotes the ith ring's color ('R', 'G', 'B').
 * The second character of the ith pair denotes the rod that the ith ring is placed on ('0' to '9').

For example, ""R3G2B1"" describes n == 3 rings: a red ring placed onto the rod labeled 3, a green ring placed onto the rod labeled 2, and a blue ring placed onto the rod labeled 1.

Abbreviating the Product of a Range - You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].

Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:

 1. Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.
    * For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.
 2. Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.
    * For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.
 3. Finally, represent the product as a string ""<pre>...<suf>eC"".
    * For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as ""12345...89876e5"".

Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].

 

Example 1:


Input: left = 1, right = 4
Output: ""24e0""
Explanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24.
There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with ""e0"".
Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.
Thus, the final representation is ""24e0"".


Example 2:


Input: left = 2, right = 11
Output: ""399168e2""
Explanation: The product is 39916800.
There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with ""e2"".
The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further.
Hence, the abbreviated product is ""399168e2"".


Example 3:


Input: left = 371, right = 375

Sequentially Ordinal Rank Tracker - A scenic location is represented by its name and attractiveness score, where name is a unique string among all locations and score is an integer. Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The higher the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the lexicographically smaller name is better.

You are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:

 * Adding scenic locations, one at a time.
 * Querying the ith best location of all locations already added, where i is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).
   * For example, when the system is queried for the 4th time, it returns the 4th best location of all locations already added.

Note that the test data are generated so that at any time, the number of queries does not exceed the number of locations added to the system.

Implement the SORTracker class:

 * SORTracker() Initializes the tracker system.
 * void add(string name, int score) Adds a scenic location with name and score to the system.
 * string get() Queries and returns the ith best location, where i is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).

Detonate the Maximum Bombs - You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb is defined as the area where its effect can be felt. This area is in the shape of a circle with the center as the location of the bomb.

The bombs are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array bombs where bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]. xi and yi denote the X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the location of the ith bomb, whereas ri denotes the radius of its range.

You may choose to detonate a single bomb. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that lie in its range. These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.

Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb.

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/06/desmos-eg-3.png]


Input: bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.
If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.
But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.
So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.

Explanation:
The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:
- Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.
- Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.
- Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.

Find Good Days to Rob the Bank - You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a 0-indexed integer array security, where security[i] is the number of guards on duty on the ith day. The days are numbered starting from 0. You are also given an integer time.

The ith day is a good day to rob the bank if:

 * There are at least time days before and after the ith day,
 * The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and
 * The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing.

More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time].

Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.

On day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5].
No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.


Example 2:


Input: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0

The nodes in the linked list are sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The length of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,

 * The 1st node is assigned to the first group.
 * The 2nd and the 3rd nodes are assigned to the second group.
 * The 4th, 5th, and 6th nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.

Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to 1 + the length of the second to last group.

Reverse the nodes in each group with an even length, and return the head of the modified linked list.

A pyramidal plot of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:

 1. The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
 2. The apex of a pyramid is the topmost cell of the pyramid. The height of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r <= i <= r + h - 1 and c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r).

Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert x = start into goal, and -1 if it is not possible.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,4,12], start = 2, goal = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: We can go from 2 → 14 → 12 with the following 2 operations.
- 2 + 12 = 14
- 14 - 2 = 12


Example 2:


Input: nums = [3,5,7], start = 0, goal = -4
Output: 2
Explanation: We can go from 0 → 3 → -4 with the following 2 operations. 
- 0 + 3 = 3
- 3 - 7 = -4
Note that the last operation sets x out of the range 0 <= x <= 1000, which is valid.

Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points - A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima.

A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance, maxDistance] where minDistance is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and maxDistance is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1].

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a1.png]


Input: head = [3,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/13/a2.png]


Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.


Example 3:

- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.

Explanation:
- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4].

Explanation: Alice will remove the only stone, and the sum of the values on the removed stones is 2. 
Since all the stones are removed and the sum of values is not divisible by 3, Bob wins the game.


Example 3:


Input: stones = [5,1,2,4,3]
Output: false
Explanation: Bob will always win. One possible way for Bob to win is shown below:
- Turn 1: Alice can remove the second stone with value 1. Sum of removed stones = 1.
- Turn 2: Bob removes the fifth stone with value 3. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 = 4.
- Turn 3: Alices removes the fourth stone with value 4. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.
- Turn 4: Bob removes the third stone with value 2. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 10.
- Turn 5: Alice removes the first stone with value 5. Sum of removed stones = 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 5 = 15.
Alice loses the game because the sum of the removed stones (15) is divisible by 3. Bob wins the game.

Find Missing Observations - You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.

You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.

Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.

Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.

 

Example 1:


Input: rolls = [3,2,4,3], mean = 4, n = 2
Output: [6,6]
Explanation: The mean of all n + m rolls is (3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 4.


Example 2:

The Time When the Network Becomes Idle - There is a network of n servers, labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates there is a message channel between servers ui and vi, and they can pass any number of messages to each other directly in one second. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array patience of length n.

All servers are connected, i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.

The server labeled 0 is the master server. The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through.

At the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:

 * If it has not, it will resend the message periodically. The data server i will resend the message every patience[i] second(s), i.e., the data server i will resend the message if patience[i] second(s) have elapsed since the last time the message was sent from this server.
 * Otherwise, no more resending will occur from this server.

The network becomes idle when there are no messages passing between servers or arriving at servers.

Return the earliest second starting from which the network becomes idle.

At (the beginning of) second 0,
- Data server 1 sends its message (denoted 1A) to the master server.
- Data server 2 sends its message (denoted 2A) to the master server.

At second 1,
- Message 1A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 1A instantly and sends a reply 1A back.
- Server 1 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 < patience[1] = 2) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it does not resend the message.
- Server 2 has not received any reply. 1 second (1 == patience[2] = 1) elapsed since this server has sent the message, therefore it resends the message (denoted 2B).

At second 2,
- The reply 1A arrives at server 1. No more resending will occur from server 1.
- Message 2A arrives at the master server. Master server processes message 2A instantly and sends a reply 2A back.
- Server 2 resends the message (denoted 2C).

AAABABB -> AABABB
Alice moves first.
She removes the second 'A' from the left since that is the only 'A' whose neighbors are both 'A'.

Now it's Bob's turn.
Bob cannot make a move on his turn since there are no 'B's whose neighbors are both 'B'.

A subsequence seq is repeated k times in the string s if seq * k is a subsequence of s, where seq * k represents a string constructed by concatenating seq k times.

 * For example, ""bba"" is repeated 2 times in the string ""bababcba"", because the string ""bbabba"", constructed by concatenating ""bba"" 2 times, is a subsequence of the string ""bababcba"".

Return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string s. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the lexicographically largest one. If there is no such subsequence, return an empty string.

 * if you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit a room with a lower or equal room number specified by nextVisit[i] where 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i;
 * if you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit room (i + 1) mod n.

Return the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: nextVisit = [0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- On day 0, you visit room 0. The total times you have been in room 0 is 1, which is odd.
  On the next day you will visit room nextVisit[0] = 0
- On day 1, you visit room 0, The total times you have been in room 0 is 2, which is even.
  On the next day you will visit room (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1
- On day 2, you visit room 1. This is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.


Example 2:


Input: nextVisit = [0,0,2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Your room visiting order for each day is: [0,0,1,0,0,1,2,...].
Day 6 is the first day where you have been in all the rooms.


Example 3:

Operations on Tree - You are given a tree with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 in the form of a parent array parent where parent[i] is the parent of the ith node. The root of the tree is node 0, so parent[0] = -1 since it has no parent. You want to design a data structure that allows users to lock, unlock, and upgrade nodes in the tree.

The data structure should support the following functions:

 * Lock: Locks the given node for the given user and prevents other users from locking the same node. You may only lock a node using this function if the node is unlocked.
 * Unlock: Unlocks the given node for the given user. You may only unlock a node using this function if it is currently locked by the same user.
 * Upgrade: Locks the given node for the given user and unlocks all of its descendants regardless of who locked it. You may only upgrade a node if all 3 conditions are true:
   * The node is unlocked,
   * It has at least one locked descendant (by any user), and
   * It does not have any locked ancestors.

Implement the LockingTree class:

 * LockingTree(int[] parent) initializes the data structure with the parent array.
 * lock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to lock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become locked by the user with id user.
 * unlock(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to unlock the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will become unlocked.
 * upgrade(int num, int user) returns true if it is possible for the user with id user to upgrade the node num, or false otherwise. If it is possible, the node num will be upgraded.

Output: ""832""
Explanation: Replace the substring ""1"":
- 1 maps to change[1] = 8.
Thus, ""132"" becomes ""832"".
""832"" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.


Example 2:


Input: num = ""021"", change = [9,4,3,5,7,2,1,9,0,6]
Output: ""934""
Explanation: Replace the substring ""021"":
- 0 maps to change[0] = 9.
- 2 maps to change[2] = 3.
- 1 maps to change[1] = 4.
Thus, ""021"" becomes ""934"".
""934"" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.


Example 3:


Input: num = ""5"", change = [1,4,7,5,3,2,5,6,9,4]
Output: ""5""
Explanation: ""5"" is already the largest number that can be created, so return it.

Sum of Digits of String After Convert - You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer k.

First, convert s into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26). Then, transform the integer by replacing it with the sum of its digits. Repeat the transform operation k times in total.

For example, if s = ""zbax"" and k = 2, then the resulting integer would be 8 by the following operations:

 * Convert: ""zbax"" ➝ ""(26)(2)(1)(24)"" ➝ ""262124"" ➝ 262124
 * Transform #1: 262124 ➝ 2 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 ➝ 17
 * Transform #2: 17 ➝ 1 + 7 ➝ 8

Return the resulting integer after performing the operations described above.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""iiii"", k = 1
Output: 36
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: ""iiii"" ➝ ""(9)(9)(9)(9)"" ➝ ""9999"" ➝ 9999
- Transform #1: 9999 ➝ 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 ➝ 36
Thus the resulting integer is 36.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""leetcode"", k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The operations are as follows:
- Convert: ""leetcode"" ➝ ""(12)(5)(5)(20)(3)(15)(4)(5)"" ➝ ""12552031545"" ➝ 12552031545
- Transform #1: 12552031545 ➝ 1 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 ➝ 33
- Transform #2: 33 ➝ 3 + 3 ➝ 6
Thus the resulting integer is 6.

 1. Choose an index i where num[i] == '?'.
 2. Replace num[i] with any digit between '0' and '9'.

The game ends when there are no more '?' characters in num.

For Bob to win, the sum of the digits in the first half of num must be equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. For Alice to win, the sums must not be equal.

 * For example, if the game ended with num = ""243801"", then Bob wins because 2+4+3 = 8+0+1. If the game ended with num = ""243803"", then Alice wins because 2+4+3 != 8+0+3.

Explanation: There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].
[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.
Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.
Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.

Minimum Absolute Difference Queries - The minimum absolute difference of an array a is defined as the minimum value of |a[i] - a[j]|, where 0 <= i < j < a.length and a[i] != a[j]. If all elements of a are the same, the minimum absolute difference is -1.

 * For example, the minimum absolute difference of the array [5,2,3,7,2] is |2 - 3| = 1. Note that it is not 0 because a[i] and a[j] must be different.

You are given an integer array nums and the array queries where queries[i] = [li, ri]. For each query i, compute the minimum absolute difference of the subarray nums[li...ri] containing the elements of nums between the 0-based indices li and ri (inclusive).

Return an array ans where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements in an array.

Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors - You are given two identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n.

You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.

In each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves.

Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.


Example 2:


Input: n = 100
Output: 14
Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
- Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 8 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 8 = 9.
- If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is between 9 and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 more drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
- If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 34, 45, 55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.
Regardless of the outcome, it takes at most 14 drops to determine f.

The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete - There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).

The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

 * For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
   * Player 1 competes against player 7.
   * Player 2 competes against player 6.
   * Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.

After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).

The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.

Given the integers n, firstPlayer, and secondPlayer, return an integer array containing two values, the earliest possible round number and the latest possible round number in which these two players will compete against each other, respectively.

You want to choose an integer k (0 <= k <= removable.length) such that, after removing k characters from s using the first k indices in removable, p is still a subsequence of s. More formally, you will mark the character at s[removable[i]] for each 0 <= i < k, then remove all marked characters and check if p is still a subsequence.

Return the maximum k you can choose such that p is still a subsequence of s after the removals.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""abcacb"", p = ""ab"", removable = [3,1,0]

Explanation: After removing the characters at indices 3 and 1, ""abcacb"" becomes ""accb"".
""ab"" is a subsequence of ""accb"".
If we remove the characters at indices 3, 1, and 0, ""abcacb"" becomes ""ccb"", and ""ab"" is no longer a subsequence.

The system should support the following functions:

 * Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.
 * Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.
 * Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.
 * Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list res where res[j] = [shopj, moviej] describes that the jth cheapest rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj. The movies in res should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopj should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the smaller moviej should appear first.

 * void drop(int shop, int movie) Drops off a previously rented movie at the given shop.
 * List<List<Integer>> report() Returns a list of cheapest rented movies as described above.

Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum - The alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.

 * For example, the alternating sum of [4,2,5,3] is (4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4.

Given an array nums, return the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of nums (after reindexing the elements of the subsequence).

A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, [2,7,4] is a subsequence of [4,2,3,7,2,1,4] (the underlined elements), while [2,4,2] is not.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]

Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging - You have n packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box. There are m suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.

The package sizes are given as an integer array packages, where packages[i] is the size of the ith package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.

You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.

 * For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.

Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or -1 if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.

After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.

 * For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait.

However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.

 * For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.

Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk - There are n students in a class numbered from 0 to n - 1. The teacher will give each student a problem starting with the student number 0, then the student number 1, and so on until the teacher reaches the student number n - 1. After that, the teacher will restart the process, starting with the student number 0 again.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array chalk and an integer k. There are initially k pieces of chalk. When the student number i is given a problem to solve, they will use chalk[i] pieces of chalk to solve that problem. However, if the current number of chalk pieces is strictly less than chalk[i], then the student number i will be asked to replace the chalk.

Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk pieces.

 

Example 1:


Input: chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22
Output: 0
Explanation: The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.

Example 2:

There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is more than one, they will do the following:

 1. Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row.
 2. Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score.
 3. Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when only one stone is left in the row.

The score difference between Alice and Bob is (Alice's score - Bob's score). Alice's goal is to maximize the score difference, and Bob's goal is the minimize the score difference.

Given an integer array stones of length n where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the left, return the score difference between Alice and Bob if they both play optimally.

 

Example 1:


Input: stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
Output: 5
Explanation:
- Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of
  value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5].
- Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on

To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the ith train ride.

Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.

Find the Winner of the Circular Game - There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:

 1. Start at the 1st friend.
 2. Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
 3. The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
 4. If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
 5. Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.

Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.

The absolute sum difference of arrays nums1 and nums2 is defined as the sum of |nums1[i] - nums2[i]| for each 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

You can replace at most one element of nums1 with any other element in nums1 to minimize the absolute sum difference.

Return the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in the array nums1. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,7,5] => [1,1,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,7,5] => [1,5,5].
Both will yield an absolute sum difference of |1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| = 3.


Example 2:


Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]

The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi, timei] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute timei.

Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.

Return the array answer as described above.

 

Example 1:


Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
Output: [0,2,0,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).
The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.
Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.


Example 2:


Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4

Number of Orders in the Backlog - You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei] denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei is:

 * 0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or

Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by orders[i+1] for all valid i.

There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:

 * If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.
 * Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current sell order's price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog.

Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.
- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.

Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.
- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

Design Authentication Manager - There is an authentication system that works with authentication tokens. For each session, the user will receive a new authentication token that will expire timeToLive seconds after the currentTime. If the token is renewed, the expiry time will be extended to expire timeToLive seconds after the (potentially different) currentTime.

Implement the AuthenticationManager class:

 * AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) constructs the AuthenticationManager and sets the timeToLive.
 * generate(string tokenId, int currentTime) generates a new token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds.
 * renew(string tokenId, int currentTime) renews the unexpired token with the given tokenId at the given currentTime in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given tokenId, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.
 * countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given currentTime.

Note that if a token expires at time t, and another action happens on time t (renew or countUnexpiredTokens), the expiration takes place before the other actions.

To represent this tree, you are given an integer array nums and a 2D array edges. Each nums[i] represents the ith node's value, and each edges[j] = [uj, vj] represents an edge between nodes uj and vj in the tree.

Two values x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1 where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.

An ancestor of a node i is any other node on the shortest path from node i to the root. A node is not considered an ancestor of itself.

Return true if you can do this task, and false otherwise.

Note that the subarrays are disjoint if and only if there is no index k such that nums[k] belongs to more than one subarray. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

 * arrivali is the arrival time of the ith customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order.
 * timei is the time needed to prepare the order of the ith customer.

When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order. The chef does not prepare food for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were given in the input.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within 10-5 from the actual answer are considered accepted.

 

Example 1:


Input: customers = [[1,2],[2,5],[4,3]]
Output: 5.00000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 1, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 1, and finishes at time 3, so the waiting time of the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 2, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 3, and finishes at time 8, so the waiting time of the second customer is 8 - 2 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 4, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 8, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the third customer is 11 - 4 = 7.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.


Example 2:


Input: customers = [[5,2],[5,4],[10,3],[20,1]]
Output: 3.25000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 5, and finishes at time 7, so the waiting time of the first customer is 7 - 5 = 2.
2) The second customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 7, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the second customer is 11 - 5 = 6.
3) The third customer arrives at time 10, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 11, and finishes at time 14, so the waiting time of the third customer is 14 - 10 = 4.
4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the waiting time of the fourth customer is 21 - 20 = 1.
So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 3.25.

Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch - The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.

The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:

 * If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
 * Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.

This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue).

 * ports i is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is the weight of the ith box.
 * portsCount is the number of ports.
 * maxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.

The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:

 * The ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
 * For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.
 * The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.

Ways to Make a Fair Array - You are given an integer array nums. You can choose exactly one index (0-indexed) and remove the element. Notice that the index of the elements may change after the removal.

For example, if nums = [6,1,7,4,1]:

 * Choosing to remove index 1 results in nums = [6,7,4,1].
 * Choosing to remove index 2 results in nums = [6,1,4,1].
 * Choosing to remove index 4 results in nums = [6,1,7,4].

An array is fair if the sum of the odd-indexed values equals the sum of the even-indexed values.

Return the number of indices that you could choose such that after the removal, nums is fair.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,1,6,4]

Maximize Grid Happiness - You are given four integers, m, n, introvertsCount, and extrovertsCount. You have an m x n grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are introvertsCount introverts and extrovertsCount extroverts.

You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.

The happiness of each person is calculated as follows:

 * Introverts start with 120 happiness and lose 30 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
 * Extroverts start with 40 happiness and gain 20 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.

The grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/grid_happiness.png]


Input: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
Output: 240
Explanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.


Example 2:


Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your inventory. For example, if you own 6 yellow balls, the customer would pay 6 for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only 5 yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at 5 (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

Output: ""c""
Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9).
Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 29).
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 49 - 29 = 20 (pressed at time 29 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 49).
Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 50).
The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for 'c', both with duration 20.
'c' is lexicographically larger than 'b', so the answer is 'c'.


Example 2:


Input: releaseTimes = [12,23,36,46,62], keysPressed = ""spuda""
Output: ""a""
Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 's' had a duration of 12.
Keypress for 'p' had a duration of 23 - 12 = 11.
Keypress for 'u' had a duration of 36 - 23 = 13.
Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 46 - 36 = 10.
Keypress for 'a' had a duration of 62 - 46 = 16.
The longest of these was the keypress for 'a' with duration 16.

Maximum Number of Visible Points - You are given an array points, an integer angle, and your location, where location = [posx, posy] and points[i] = [xi, yi] both denote integral coordinates on the X-Y plane.

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move from your position, but you can rotate. In other words, posx and posy cannot be changed. Your field of view in degrees is represented by angle, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let d be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the inclusive range of angles [d - angle/2, d + angle/2].

Your browser does not support the video tag or this video format.

You can see some set of points if, for each point, the angle formed by the point, your position, and the immediate east direction from your position is in your field of view.

There can be multiple points at one coordinate. There may be points at your location, and you can always see these points regardless of your rotation. Points do not obstruct your vision to other points.

Return the maximum number of points you can see.

Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality - You are given an array of network towers towers, where towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi] denotes the ith network tower with location (xi, yi) and quality factor qi. All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between the two coordinates is the Euclidean distance.

You are also given an integer radius where a tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to radius. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.

The signal quality of the ith tower at a coordinate (x, y) is calculated with the formula ⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋, where d is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.

Return the array [cx, cy] representing the integral coordinate (cx, cy) where the network quality is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, return the lexicographically minimum non-negative coordinate.

Note:

 * A coordinate (x1, y1) is lexicographically smaller than (x2, y2) if either:
   * x1 < x2, or

Throne Inheritance - A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function Successor(x, curOrder), which given a person x and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after x in the order of inheritance.


Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder


For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.

 1. In the beginning, curOrder will be [""king""].
 2. Calling Successor(king, curOrder) will return Alice, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice""].
 3. Calling Successor(Alice, curOrder) will return Jack, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""].
 4. Calling Successor(Jack, curOrder) will return Bob, so we append to curOrder to get [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].
 5. Calling Successor(Bob, curOrder) will return null. Thus the order of inheritance will be [""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""].

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.

Implement the ThroneInheritance class:

 * ThroneInheritance(string kingName) Initializes an object of the ThroneInheritance class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.
 * void birth(string parentName, string childName) Indicates that parentName gave birth to childName.
 * void death(string name) Indicates the death of name. The death of the person doesn't affect the Successor function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.
 * string[] getInheritanceOrder() Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel - You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, and each gondola has room for up to four people. You have the ability to rotate the gondolas counterclockwise, which costs you runningCost dollars.

You are given an array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of new customers arriving just before the ith rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel i times before the customers[i] customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays boardingCost dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.

You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.

Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return -1.

 

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/wheeldiagram12.png]


Input: customers = [8,3], boardingCost = 5, runningCost = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers written on the gondolas are the number of people currently there.
1. 8 customers arrive, 4 board and 4 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $5 - 1 * $6 = $14.
2. 3 customers arrive, the 4 waiting board the wheel and the other 3 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $5 - 2 * $6 = $28.
3. The final 3 customers board the gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $5 - 3 * $6 = $37.
The highest profit was $37 after rotating the wheel 3 times.


Example 2:


Input: customers = [10,9,6], boardingCost = 6, runningCost = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
1. 10 customers arrive, 4 board and 6 wait for the next gondola, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 4 * $6 - 1 * $4 = $20.
2. 9 customers arrive, 4 board and 11 wait (2 originally waiting, 9 newly waiting), the wheel rotates. Current profit is 8 * $6 - 2 * $4 = $40.
3. The final 6 customers arrive, 4 board and 13 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 12 * $6 - 3 * $4 = $60.
4. 4 board and 9 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 16 * $6 - 4 * $4 = $80.
5. 4 board and 5 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 20 * $6 - 5 * $4 = $100.
6. 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 24 * $6 - 6 * $4 = $120.
7. 1 boards, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 25 * $6 - 7 * $4 = $122.
The highest profit was $122 after rotating the wheel 7 times.


Example 3:


Input: customers = [3,4,0,5,1], boardingCost = 1, runningCost = 92
Output: -1
Explanation:
1. 3 customers arrive, 3 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 3 * $1 - 1 * $92 = -$89.
2. 4 customers arrive, 4 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 2 * $92 = -$177.
3. 0 customers arrive, 0 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 7 * $1 - 3 * $92 = -$269.
4. 5 customers arrive, 4 board and 1 waits, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 11 * $1 - 4 * $92 = -$357.
5. 1 customer arrives, 2 board and 0 wait, the wheel rotates. Current profit is 13 * $1 - 5 * $92 = -$447.

 * The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
 * If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
 * If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
 * Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.

Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.

All the friends are divided into pairs. The pairings are given in a list pairs, where pairs[i] = [xi, yi] denotes xi is paired with yi and yi is paired with xi.

However, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. A friend x is unhappy if x is paired with y and there exists a friend u who is paired with v but:

 * x prefers u over y, and
 * u prefers x over v.

In each round of the game, Alice divides the row into two non-empty rows (i.e. left row and right row), then Bob calculates the value of each row which is the sum of the values of all the stones in this row. Bob throws away the row which has the maximum value, and Alice's score increases by the value of the remaining row. If the value of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide which row will be thrown away. The next round starts with the remaining row.

The game ends when there is only one stone remaining. Alice's is initially zero.

Return the maximum score that Alice can obtain.

 

Example 1:


Input: stoneValue = [6,2,3,4,5,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: In the first round, Alice divides the row to [6,2,3], [4,5,5]. The left row has the value 11 and the right row has value 14. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 11.
In the second round Alice divides the row to [6], [2,3]. This time Bob throws away the left row and Alice's score becomes 16 (11 + 5).
The last round Alice has only one choice to divide the row which is [2], [3]. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 18 (16 + 2). The game ends because only one stone is remaining in the row.

Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/21/e11.jpg]
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

Find a Value of a Mysterious Function Closest to Target - [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/09/change.png]

Winston was given the above mysterious function func. He has an integer array arr and an integer target and he wants to find the values l and r that make the value |func(arr, l, r) - target| minimum possible.

Return the minimum possible value of |func(arr, l, r) - target|.

Notice that func should be called with the values l and r where 0 <= l, r < arr.length.

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [9,12,3,7,15], target = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Calling func with all the pairs of [l,r] = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4],[0,3],[1,4],[0,4]], Winston got the following results [9,12,3,7,15,8,0,3,7,0,0,3,0,0,0]. The value closest to 5 is 7 and 3, thus the minimum difference is 2.


Example 2:


Input: arr = [1000000,1000000,1000000], target = 1
Output: 999999
Explanation: Winston called the func with all possible values of [l,r] and he always got 1000000, thus the min difference is 999999.

Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings - Given a string s of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of s that meet the following conditions:

 1. The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[x..y], either j < x or i > y is true.
 2. A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.

Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""adefaddaccc""
Output: [""e"",""f"",""ccc""]
Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  ""adefaddaccc""
  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",
  ""ccc"",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""abbaccd""
Output: [""d"",""bb"",""cc""]
Explanation: Notice that while the set of substrings [""d"",""abba"",""cc""] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.

Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).

String Compression II - Run-length encoding [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding] is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string ""aabccc"" we replace ""aa"" by ""a2"" and replace ""ccc"" by ""c3"". Thus the compressed string becomes ""a2bc3"".

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.

Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be ""a3c3"" of length 4.

Example 2:


Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 2

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:
[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/04/msts.png]
Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.

Given an integer array rains where:

 * rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.

Explanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
Here is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position ((n - 1) / 2) in the sorted list (0-indexed).

 * For arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11], n = 5 and the median is obtained by sorting the array arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11] and the median is arr[m] where m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2. The median is 6.

Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).

Return the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

 

Example 1:

Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1


Example 2:


Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667

You have an empty stack with the two following operations:

 * ""Push"": pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
 * ""Pop"": removes the integer on the top of the stack.

You also have a stream of the integers in the range [1, n].

Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to target. You should follow the following rules:

 * If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
 * If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
 * If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to target, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.

Return the stack operations needed to build target following the mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them.

 

Example 1:


Input: target = [1,3], n = 3

Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,3].


Example 2:


Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: [""Push"",""Push"",""Push""]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2,3].


Example 3:


Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: [""Push"",""Push""]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Since the stack (from the bottom to the top) is equal to target, we stop the stack operations.
The answers that read integer 3 from the stream are not accepted.

Explanation: 
Leetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.
Handbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.
Corona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.

Stone Game III - Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win, or ""Tie"" if they will end the game with the same score.

 

Example 1:


Input: values = [1,2,3,7]
Output: ""Bob""
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.


Example 2:


Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: ""Alice""
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.


Example 3:


Input: values = [1,2,3,6]
Output: ""Tie""
Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.

For example, the power of x = 3 is 7 because 3 needs 7 steps to become 1 (3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1).

Given three integers lo, hi and k. The task is to sort all integers in the interval [lo, hi] by the power value in ascending order, if two or more integers have the same power value sort them by ascending order.

Return the kth integer in the range [lo, hi] sorted by the power value.

Notice that for any integer x (lo <= x <= hi) it is guaranteed that x will transform into 1 using these steps and that the power of x is will fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:


Input: lo = 12, hi = 15, k = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: The power of 12 is 9 (12 --> 6 --> 3 --> 10 --> 5 --> 16 --> 8 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1)
The power of 13 is 9
The power of 14 is 17
The power of 15 is 17
The interval sorted by the power value [12,13,14,15]. For k = 2 answer is the second element which is 13.
Notice that 12 and 13 have the same power value and we sorted them in ascending order. Same for 14 and 15.


Example 2:


Input: lo = 7, hi = 11, k = 4
Output: 7
Explanation: The power array corresponding to the interval [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] is [16, 3, 19, 6, 14].
The interval sorted by power is [8, 10, 11, 7, 9].
The fourth number in the sorted array is 7.

Tweet Counts Per Frequency - A social media company is trying to monitor activity on their site by analyzing the number of tweets that occur in select periods of time. These periods can be partitioned into smaller time chunks based on a certain frequency (every minute, hour, or day).

For example, the period [10, 10000] (in seconds) would be partitioned into the following time chunks with these frequencies:

 * Every minute (60-second chunks): [10,69], [70,129], [130,189], ..., [9970,10000]
 * Every hour (3600-second chunks): [10,3609], [3610,7209], [7210,10000]
 * Every day (86400-second chunks): [10,10000]

Notice that the last chunk may be shorter than the specified frequency's chunk size and will always end with the end time of the period (10000 in the above example).

Design and implement an API to help the company with their analysis.

Implement the TweetCounts class:

 * TweetCounts() Initializes the TweetCounts object.
 * void recordTweet(String tweetName, int time) Stores the tweetName at the recorded time (in seconds).
 * List<Integer> getTweetCountsPerFrequency(String freq, String tweetName, int startTime, int endTime) Returns a list of integers representing the number of tweets with tweetName in each time chunk for the given period of time [startTime, endTime] (in seconds) and frequency freq.

Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance - Given the array restaurants where  restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The veganFriendly filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with veganFriendlyi set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters maxPrice and maxDistance which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.

Encrypt and Decrypt Strings - You are given a character array keys containing unique characters and a string array values containing strings of length 2. You are also given another string array dictionary that contains all permitted original strings after decryption. You should implement a data structure that can encrypt or decrypt a 0-indexed string.

A string is encrypted with the following process:

 1. For each character c in the string, we find the index i satisfying keys[i] == c in keys.
 2. Replace c with values[i] in the string.

Note that in case a character of the string is not present in keys, the encryption process cannot be carried out, and an empty string """" is returned.

A string is decrypted with the following process:

 1. For each substring s of length 2 occurring at an even index in the string, we find an i such that values[i] == s. If there are multiple valid i, we choose any one of them. This means a string could have multiple possible strings it can decrypt to.
 2. Replace s with keys[i] in the string.

Implement the Encrypter class:

 * Encrypter(char[] keys, String[] values, String[] dictionary) Initializes the Encrypter class with keys, values, and dictionary.
 * String encrypt(String word1) Encrypts word1 with the encryption process described above and returns the encrypted string.

Fair Distribution of Cookies - You are given an integer array cookies, where cookies[i] denotes the number of cookies in the ith bag. You are also given an integer k that denotes the number of children to distribute all the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.

The unfairness of a distribution is defined as the maximum total cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.

Return the minimum unfairness of all distributions.

 

Example 1:


Input: cookies = [8,15,10,20,8], k = 2
Output: 31
Explanation: One optimal distribution is [8,15,8] and [10,20]
- The 1st child receives [8,15,8] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.
- The 2nd child receives [10,20] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.

Minimum Path Cost in a Grid - You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix grid consisting of distinct integers from 0 to m * n - 1. You can move in this matrix from a cell to any other cell in the next row. That is, if you are in cell (x, y) such that x < m - 1, you can move to any of the cells (x + 1, 0), (x + 1, 1), ..., (x + 1, n - 1). Note that it is not possible to move from cells in the last row.

Each possible move has a cost given by a 0-indexed 2D array moveCost of size (m * n) x n, where moveCost[i][j] is the cost of moving from a cell with value i to a cell in column j of the next row. The cost of moving from cells in the last row of grid can be ignored.

The cost of a path in grid is the sum of all values of cells visited plus the sum of costs of all the moves made. Return the minimum cost of a path that starts from any cell in the first row and ends at any cell in the last row.

Input: grid = [[5,3],[4,0],[2,1]], moveCost = [[9,8],[1,5],[10,12],[18,6],[2,4],[14,3]]
Output: 17
Explanation: The path with the minimum possible cost is the path 5 -> 0 -> 1.
- The sum of the values of cells visited is 5 + 0 + 1 = 6.
- The cost of moving from 5 to 0 is 3.
- The cost of moving from 0 to 1 is 8.
So the total cost of the path is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17.


Example 2:


Input: grid = [[5,1,2],[4,0,3]], moveCost = [[12,10,15],[20,23,8],[21,7,1],[8,1,13],[9,10,25],[5,3,2]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The path with the minimum possible cost is the path 2 -> 3.
- The sum of the values of cells visited is 2 + 3 = 5.
- The cost of moving from 2 to 3 is 1.
So the total cost of this path is 5 + 1 = 6.

Explanation:
For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].

Selling Pieces of Wood - You are given two integers m and n that represent the height and width of a rectangular piece of wood. You are also given a 2D integer array prices, where prices[i] = [hi, wi, pricei] indicates you can sell a rectangular piece of wood of height hi and width wi for pricei dollars.

To cut a piece of wood, you must make a vertical or horizontal cut across the entire height or width of the piece to split it into two smaller pieces. After cutting a piece of wood into some number of smaller pieces, you can sell pieces according to prices. You may sell multiple pieces of the same shape, and you do not have to sell all the shapes. The grain of the wood makes a difference, so you cannot rotate a piece to swap its height and width.

Return the maximum money you can earn after cutting an m x n piece of wood.

Note that you can cut the piece of wood as many times as you want.

- 2 pieces of wood shaped 2 x 2, selling for a price of 2 * 7 = 14.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 2 x 1, selling for a price of 1 * 3 = 3.
- 1 piece of wood shaped 1 x 4, selling for a price of 1 * 2 = 2.
This obtains a total of 14 + 3 + 2 = 19 money earned.
It can be shown that 19 is the maximum amount of money that can be earned.

Example 1:


Input: s = ""aabb""
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can obtain two palindromes from s, ""abba"" and ""baab"". 
- We can obtain ""abba"" from s in 2 moves: ""aabb"" -> ""abab"" -> ""abba"".
- We can obtain ""baab"" from s in 2 moves: ""aabb"" -> ""abab"" -> ""baab"".
Thus, the minimum number of moves needed to make s a palindrome is 2.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""letelt""
Output: 2
Explanation:
One of the palindromes we can obtain from s in 2 moves is ""lettel"".
One of the ways we can obtain it is ""letelt"" -> ""letetl"" -> ""lettel"".
Other palindromes such as ""tleelt"" can also be obtained in 2 moves.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a palindrome in less than 2 moves.

Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams - You are given a 0-indexed string array words, where words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

In one operation, select any index i such that 0 < i < words.length and words[i - 1] and words[i] are anagrams, and delete words[i] from words. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.

Return words after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase using all the original letters exactly once. For example, ""dacb"" is an anagram of ""abdc"".

 

Example 1:


Input: words = [""abba"",""baba"",""bbaa"",""cd"",""cd""]
Output: [""abba"",""cd""]
Explanation:
One of the ways we can obtain the resultant array is by using the following operations:
- Since words[2] = ""bbaa"" and words[1] = ""baba"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [""abba"",""baba"",""cd"",""cd""].
- Since words[1] = ""baba"" and words[0] = ""abba"" are anagrams, we choose index 1 and delete words[1].
  Now words = [""abba"",""cd"",""cd""].
- Since words[2] = ""cd"" and words[1] = ""cd"" are anagrams, we choose index 2 and delete words[2].
  Now words = [""abba"",""cd""].
We can no longer perform any operations, so [""abba"",""cd""] is the final answer.

Example 2:


Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e""]
Output: [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d"",""e""]

Explanation:
One of the ways we can end with 5 at the top of the pile after 4 moves is as follows:
- Step 1: Remove the topmost element = 5. The pile becomes [2,2,4,0,6].
- Step 2: Remove the topmost element = 2. The pile becomes [2,4,0,6].
- Step 3: Remove the topmost element = 2. The pile becomes [4,0,6].
- Step 4: Add 5 back onto the pile. The pile becomes [5,4,0,6].

The Dining Philosophers - Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem]

 

The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork) where:

 * philosopher is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.
 * pickLeftFork and pickRightFork are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
 * eat is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.
 * putLeftFork and putRightFork are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.
 * The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.

A skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.

For example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:

Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skip_list_add_element-en.gif]

You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

See more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list]

Implement the Skiplist class:

 * Skiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.
 * bool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.
 * void add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.
 * bool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.

Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

 

Example 1:


Input
[""Skiplist"", ""add"", ""add"", ""add"", ""search"", ""add"", ""search"", ""erase"", ""erase"", ""search""]
[[], [1], [2], [3], [0], [4], [1], [0], [1], [1]]
Output

Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings - You are given a 0-indexed string s and are tasked with finding two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.

More formally, you want to choose four integers i, j, k, l such that 0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length and both the substrings s[i...j] and s[k...l] are palindromes and have odd lengths. s[i...j] denotes a substring from index i to index j inclusive.

Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children - You are given a 0-indexed integer array candies. Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies of size candies[i]. You can divide each pile into any number of sub piles, but you cannot merge two piles together.

You are also given an integer k. You should allocate piles of candies to k children such that each child gets the same number of candies. Each child can take at most one pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.

Return the maximum number of candies each child can get.

 

Example 1:


Input: candies = [5,8,6], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.


Example 2:


Input: candies = [2,5], k = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.

Sort the Jumbled Numbers - You are given a 0-indexed integer array mapping which represents the mapping rule of a shuffled decimal system. mapping[i] = j means digit i should be mapped to digit j in this system.

The mapped value of an integer is the new integer obtained by replacing each occurrence of digit i in the integer with mapping[i] for all 0 <= i <= 9.

You are also given another integer array nums. Return the array nums sorted in non-decreasing order based on the mapped values of its elements.

Notes:

 * Elements with the same mapped values should appear in the same relative order as in the input.
 * The elements of nums should only be sorted based on their mapped values and not be replaced by them.

 

Example 1:


Input: mapping = [8,9,4,0,2,1,3,5,7,6], nums = [991,338,38]
Output: [338,38,991]
Explanation: 
Map the number 991 as follows:
1. mapping[9] = 6, so all occurrences of the digit 9 will become 6.
2. mapping[1] = 9, so all occurrences of the digit 1 will become 9.
Therefore, the mapped value of 991 is 669.
338 maps to 007, or 7 after removing the leading zeros.
38 maps to 07, which is also 7 after removing leading zeros.
Since 338 and 38 share the same mapped value, they should remain in the same relative order, so 338 comes before 38.
Thus, the sorted array is [338,38,991].

Input: mapping = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], nums = [789,456,123]

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:

 * Water the plants in order from left to right.
 * After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.
 * You cannot refill the watering can early.

You are initially at the river (i.e., x = -1). It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player. In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn. If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

Stone Game II - Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.  Initially, M = 1.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

 

Example 1:


Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]

Explanation:  If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger.

 * For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}.
 * For expressions e1, e2, ... , ek with k >= 2, we have R({e1, e2, ...}) = R(e1) ∪ R(e2) ∪ ...
 * For expressions e1 and e2, we have R(e1 + e2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e1) × R(e2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

Given an expression representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.

 

Example 1:


Input: expression = ""{a,b}{c,{d,e}}""
Output: [""ac"",""ad"",""ae"",""bc"",""bd"",""be""]


Example 2:

There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given releaseHydrogen and releaseOxygen methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:

 * If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it must wait for two hydrogen threads.
 * If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it must wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

We do not have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is that threads pass the barriers in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bind and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

Given a mountain array mountainArr, return the minimum index such that mountainArr.get(index) == target. If such an index does not exist, return -1.

You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access the array using a MountainArray interface:

 * MountainArray.get(k) returns the element of the array at index k (0-indexed).
 * MountainArray.length() returns the length of the array.

Submissions making more than 100 calls to MountainArray.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

 * If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
 * If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

 

Example 1:


Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,

Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String - You are given two strings of the same length s1 and s2 and a string baseStr.

We say s1[i] and s2[i] are equivalent characters.

 * For example, if s1 = ""abc"" and s2 = ""cde"", then we have 'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', and 'c' == 'e'.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

 * Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'.
 * Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'.
 * Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'.

For example, given the equivalency information from s1 = ""abc"" and s2 = ""cde"", ""acd"" and ""aab"" are equivalent strings of baseStr = ""eed"", and ""aab"" is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of baseStr by using the equivalency information from s1 and s2.

 

Example 1:


Input: s1 = ""parker"", s2 = ""morris"", baseStr = ""parser""
Output: ""makkek""
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is ""makkek"".


Example 2:


Input: s1 = ""hello"", s2 = ""world"", baseStr = ""hold""
Output: ""hdld""
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is ""hdld"".


Example 3:


Input: s1 = ""leetcode"", s2 = ""programs"", baseStr = ""sourcecode""
Output: ""aauaaaaada""
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is ""aauaaaaada"".

 * For example, factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

We make a clumsy factorial using the integers in decreasing order by swapping out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations with multiply '*', divide '/', add '+', and subtract '-' in this order.

 * For example, clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1.

However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic. We do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.

 * During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
 * During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.
 * It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).

Return the number of good starting indices.

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.
From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.
From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.
In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.


Example 2:


Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].
During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].
We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.
In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.
From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.
From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.
In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some
number of jumps.


Example 3:


Input: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.

Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.

Equal Rational Numbers - Given two strings s and t, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return true if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.

A rational number can be represented using up to three parts: <IntegerPart>, <NonRepeatingPart>, and a <RepeatingPart>. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:

 * <IntegerPart>
   * For example, 12, 0, and 123.

Some nodes initial are initially infected by malware. Whenever two nodes are directly connected, and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware. This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose M(initial) is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network after the spread of malware stops. We will remove exactly one node from initial.

You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.

There is a parameter allowedGuesses for each test case where allowedGuesses is the maximum number of times you can call Master.guess(word).

The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k.

To complete the ith replacement operation:

 1. Check if the substring sources[i] occurs at index indices[i] in the original string s.
 2. If it does not occur, do nothing.
 3. Otherwise if it does occur, replace that substring with targets[i].

For example, if s = ""abcd"", indices[i] = 0, sources[i] = ""ab"", and targets[i] = ""eee"", then the result of this replacement will be ""eeecd"".

All replacement operations must occur simultaneously, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will not overlap.

When we visit a domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"", we will also visit the parent domains ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" implicitly.

A count-paired domain is a domain that has one of the two formats ""rep d1.d2.d3"" or ""rep d1.d2"" where rep is the number of visits to the domain and d1.d2.d3 is the domain itself.

 * For example, ""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"" is a count-paired domain that indicates that discuss.leetcode.com was visited 9001 times.

Given an array of count-paired domains cpdomains, return an array of the count-paired domains of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in any order.

Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first. If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become 0, then that player loses. The bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.

Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.

Return true if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 
Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. 
If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose.

In these strings like ""heeellooo"", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same: ""h"", ""eee"", ""ll"", ""ooo"".

You are given a string s and an array of query strings words. A query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to s by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is three or more.

 * For example, starting with ""hello"", we could do an extension on the group ""o"" to get ""hellooo"", but we cannot get ""helloo"" since the group ""oo"" has a size less than three. Also, we could do another extension like ""ll"" -> ""lllll"" to get ""helllllooo"". If s = ""helllllooo"", then the query word ""hello"" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = ""hello"" -> ""hellooo"" -> ""helllllooo"" = s.

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)

 

Example 1:


Input: poured = 1, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1
Output: 0.00000
Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.


Example 2:


Input: poured = 2, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1
Output: 0.50000
Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.


Example 3:


Input: poured = 100000009, query_row = 33, query_glass = 17
Output: 1.00000

Smallest Rotation with Highest Score - You are given an array nums. You can rotate it by a non-negative integer k so that the array becomes [nums[k], nums[k + 1], ... nums[nums.length - 1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]. Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth one point.

 * For example, if we have nums = [2,4,1,3,0], and we rotate by k = 2, it becomes [1,3,0,2,4]. This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].

Return the rotation index k that corresponds to the highest score we can achieve if we rotated nums by it. If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index k.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,3,1,4,0]

Explanation: Scores for each k are listed below: 
k = 0,  nums = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2
k = 1,  nums = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3

k = 3,  nums = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4

So we should choose k = 3, which has the highest score.

Explanation: nums will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.

Rabbits in Forest - There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits ""How many rabbits have the same color as you?"" and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.

Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

 

Example 1:


Input: answers = [1,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered ""1"" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit that answered ""2"" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered ""2"" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

   * For example, we would never write a term like ""b*a*c"", only ""a*b*c"".
 * Terms have degrees equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.

 * The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.) A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.

Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad-Trees - A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.

Return a Quad-Tree representing the n * n binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by quadTree1 and quadTree2.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

 * val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
 * isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

 1. If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
 2. If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
 3. Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

Quad-Tree format:

The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].

If the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list [isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.

Output: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.
If we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.

Explanation: There could be empty list in the input.


 

Constraints:

 * The number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.

How the multilevel linked list is represented in test cases:

We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:

         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |

The serialization of each level is as follows:


[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]


To serialize all levels together, we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:


[1,    2,    3, 4, 5, 6, null]
             |
[null, null, 7,    8, 9, 10, null]

[            null, 11, 12, null]

Pyramid Transition Matrix - You are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color, which is represented by a single letter. Each row of blocks contains one less block than the row beneath it and is centered on top.

To make the pyramid aesthetically pleasing, there are only specific triangular patterns that are allowed. A triangular pattern consists of a single block stacked on top of two blocks. The patterns are given as a list of three-letter strings allowed, where the first two characters of a pattern represent the left and right bottom blocks respectively, and the third character is the top block.

 * For example, ""ABC"" represents a triangular pattern with a 'C' block stacked on top of an 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) block. Note that this is different from ""BAC"" where 'B' is on the left bottom and 'A' is on the right bottom.

You start with a bottom row of blocks bottom, given as a single string, that you must use as the base of the pyramid.

Given bottom and allowed, return true if you can build the pyramid all the way to the top such that every triangular pattern in the pyramid is in allowed, or false otherwise.

Input: bottom = ""BCD"", allowed = [""BCC"",""CDE"",""CEA"",""FFF""]
Output: true
Explanation: The allowed triangular patterns are shown on the right.
Starting from the bottom (level 3), we can build ""CE"" on level 2 and then build ""A"" on level 1.
There are three triangular patterns in the pyramid, which are ""BCC"", ""CDE"", and ""CEA"". All are allowed.

Cracking the Safe - There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be in the range [0, k - 1].

The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.

 * For example, the correct password is ""345"" and you enter in ""012345"":
   * After typing 0, the most recent 3 digits is ""0"", which is incorrect.
   * After typing 1, the most recent 3 digits is ""01"", which is incorrect.

Open the Lock - You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

Note that a sequence like ""0000"" -> ""0001"" -> ""0002"" -> ""0102"" -> ""0202"" would be invalid,

The world is modeled as an m x n binary grid isInfected, where isInfected[i][j] == 0 represents uninfected cells, and isInfected[i][j] == 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.

Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall. Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region (i.e., the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night). There will never be a tie.

A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in licensePlate. Ignore numbers and spaces in licensePlate, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in licensePlate, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.

For example, if licensePlate = ""aBc 12c"", then it contains letters 'a', 'b' (ignoring case), and 'c' twice. Possible completing words are ""abccdef"", ""caaacab"", and ""cbca"".

Return the shortest completing word in words. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in words.

 

Example 1:


Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 PSt"", words = [""step"",""steps"",""stripe"",""stepple""]

Explanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.
""step"" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.
""steps"" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.
""stripe"" is missing an 's'.
""stepple"" is missing an 's'.

Parse Lisp Expression - You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.

The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

 * An expression is either an integer, let expression, add expression, mult expression, or an assigned variable. Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.
 * (An integer could be positive or negative.)
 * A let expression takes the form ""(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)"", where let is always the string ""let"", then there are one or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let expression is the value of the expression expr.
 * An add expression takes the form ""(add e1 e2)"" where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
 * A mult expression takes the form ""(mult e1 e2)"" where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2 and the result is the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.
 * For this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names. A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits. Additionally, for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", and ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.
 * Finally, there is the concept of scope. When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially. It is guaranteed that every expression is legal. Please see the examples for more details on the scope.

 

Example 1:


Input: expression = ""(let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))""
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.
Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.


Example 2:


Input: expression = ""(let x 3 x 2 x)""
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.


Example 3:


Input: expression = ""(let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))""
Output: 5
Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.
The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on.

Remove Comments - Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\n'.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

 * The string ""//"" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
 * The string ""/*"" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of ""*/"" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string ""/*/"" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others.

 * For example, if the string ""//"" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.
 * Similarly, if the string ""/*"" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.

 * For example, source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";"" will not be a test case.

Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.

It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so ""/*"" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.

After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.

 

Example 1:


Input: source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]
Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]
Explanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for

a = b + c;
}
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.
The line by line output code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}


Example 2:


Input: source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].

You are given a 2D integer array positions where positions[i] = [lefti, sideLengthi] represents the ith square with a side length of sideLengthi that is dropped with its left edge aligned with X-coordinate lefti.

Each square is dropped one at a time from a height above any landed squares. It then falls downward (negative Y direction) until it either lands on the top side of another square or on the X-axis. A square brushing the left/right side of another square does not count as landing on it. Once it lands, it freezes in place and cannot be moved.

After each square is dropped, you must record the height of the current tallest stack of squares.

Return an integer array ans where ans[i] represents the height described above after dropping the ith square.

After the second drop, the tallest stack is squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.
After the third drop, the tallest stack is still squares 1 and 2 with a height of 5.

The rows and columns are 0-indexed, so the top-left cell is (0, 0), and the bottom-right cell is (n - 1, n - 1).

A chess knight has eight possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/knight.png]

Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.

The knight continues moving until it has made exactly k moves or has moved off the chessboard.

Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3, k = 2, row = 0, column = 0

'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...
'Z' -> ""26""


To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, ""11106"" can be mapped into:

 * ""AAJF"" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
 * ""KJF"" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because ""06"" cannot be mapped into 'F' since ""6"" is different from ""06"".

In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the '*' character, which can represent any digit from '1' to '9' ('0' is excluded). For example, the encoded message ""1*"" may represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"". Decoding ""1*"" is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.

Given a string s consisting of digits and '*' characters, return the number of ways to decode it.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""*""
Output: 9
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", or ""9"".
Each of these can be decoded to the strings ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H"", and ""I"" respectively.
Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode ""*"".


Example 2:


Input: s = ""1*""
Output: 18
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"".
Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. ""11"" can be decoded to ""AA"" or ""K"").
Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode ""1*"".


Example 3:


Input: s = ""2*""
Output: 15
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", ""26"", ""27"", ""28"", or ""29"".
""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", and ""26"" have 2 ways of being decoded, but ""27"", ""28"", and ""29"" only have 1 way.
Hence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode ""2*"".

Shopping Offers - In LeetCode Store, there are n items to sell. Each item has a price. However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given an integer array price where price[i] is the price of the ith item, and an integer array needs where needs[i] is the number of pieces of the ith item you want to buy.

You are also given an array special where special[i] is of size n + 1 where special[i][j] is the number of pieces of the jth item in the ith offer and special[i][n] (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the ith offer.

Return the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.

In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B.

Exclusive Time of Functions - On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.

Function calls are stored in a call stack [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack]: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string ""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}"". For example, ""0:start:3"" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and ""1:end:2"" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.

A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.

Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.

Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""]

Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.


Example 2:


Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.
Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.


Example 3:


Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.
Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.
Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.
Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.
Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.
So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.

Add One Row to Tree - Given the root of a binary tree and two integers val and depth, add a row of nodes with value val at the given depth depth.

Note that the root node is at depth 1.

The adding rule is:

 * Given the integer depth, for each not null tree node cur at the depth depth - 1, create two tree nodes with value val as cur's left subtree root and right subtree root.
 * cur's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.
 * cur's original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.
 * If depth == 1 that means there is no depth depth - 1 at all, then create a tree node with value val as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

Task Scheduler - Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:

 1. The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
 2. A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.
 3. A valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.
 4. A valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.
 5. A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
 6. A < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).
 7. The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.
 8. CDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.

 

Example 1:


Input: code = ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.


Example 2:


Input: code = ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: true
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""
The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.


Example 3:


Input: code = ""<A>  <B> </A>   </B>""
Output: false
Explanation: Unbalanced. If ""<A>"" is closed, then ""<B>"" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Explanation: All possible pairings (ignoring the ordering of elements) are:
1. (1, 4), (2, 3) -> min(1, 4) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3
2. (1, 3), (2, 4) -> min(1, 3) + min(2, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3

 * For example, ""abc"" is a subsequence of ""aebdc"" because you can delete the underlined characters in ""aebdc"" to get ""abc"". Other subsequences of ""aebdc"" include ""aebdc"", ""aeb"", and """" (empty string).

 

Example 1:


Input: a = ""aba"", b = ""cdc""
Output: 3
Explanation: One longest uncommon subsequence is ""aba"" because ""aba"" is a subsequence of ""aba"" but not ""cdc"".
Note that ""cdc"" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.


Example 2:


Input: a = ""aaa"", b = ""bbb""
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequences are ""aaa"" and ""bbb"".


Example 3:


Input: a = ""aaa"", b = ""aaa""
Output: -1
Explanation: Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a.

Freedom Trail - In the video game Fallout 4, the quest ""Road to Freedom"" requires players to reach a metal dial called the ""Freedom Trail Ring"" and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.

Given a string ring that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the ""12:00"" direction. You should spell all the characters in key one by one by rotating ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the ""12:00"" direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:

 1. You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the ""12:00"" direction, where this character must equal key[i].
 2. If the character key[i] has been aligned at the ""12:00"" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring ""godding"" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become ""ddinggo"".

Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
-1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 - 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
+1 + 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 3

Construct the Rectangle - A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.

In this variation of Zuma, there is a single row of colored balls on a board, where each ball can be colored red 'R', yellow 'Y', blue 'B', green 'G', or white 'W'. You also have several colored balls in your hand.

Your goal is to clear all of the balls from the board. On each turn:

 * Pick any ball from your hand and insert it in between two balls in the row or on either end of the row.
 * If there is a group of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, remove the group of balls from the board.
   * If this removal causes more groups of three or more of the same color to form, then continue removing each group until there are none left.
 * If there are no more balls on the board, then you win the game.
 * Repeat this process until you either win or do not have any more balls in your hand.

Given a string board, representing the row of balls on the board, and a string hand, representing the balls in your hand, return the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls from the board. If you cannot clear all the balls from the board using the balls in your hand, return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: board = ""WRRBBW"", hand = ""RB""
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to clear all the balls. The best you can do is:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WRRRBBW. WRRRBBW -> WBBW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WBBBW. WBBBW -> WW.
There are still balls remaining on the board, and you are out of balls to insert.

Example 2:


Input: board = ""WWRRBBWW"", hand = ""WRBRW""
Output: 2
Explanation: To make the board empty:
- Insert 'R' so the board becomes WWRRRBBWW. WWRRRBBWW -> WWBBWW.
- Insert 'B' so the board becomes WWBBBWW. WWBBBWW -> WWWW -> empty.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,5,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

 * int get(int key) Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
 * void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.

When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to 1 (due to the put operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a get or put operation is called on it.

To figure out which one is poisonous, you feed some number of (poor) pigs the liquid to see whether they will die or not. Unfortunately, you only have minutesToTest minutes to determine which bucket is poisonous.

You can feed the pigs according to these steps:

 1. Choose some live pigs to feed.
 2. For each pig, choose which buckets to feed it. The pig will consume all the chosen buckets simultaneously and will take no time. Each pig can feed from any number of buckets, and each bucket can be fed from by any number of pigs.
 3. Wait for minutesToDie minutes. You may not feed any other pigs during this time.
 4. After minutesToDie minutes have passed, any pigs that have been fed the poisonous bucket will die, and all others will survive.
 5. Repeat this process until you run out of time.

Given buckets, minutesToDie, and minutesToTest, return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket is poisonous within the allotted time.

 2. For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.

x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.

Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

Longest Absolute File Path - Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/28/mdir.jpg]

Here, we have dir as the only directory in the root. dir contains two subdirectories, subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 contains a file file1.ext and subdirectory subsubdir1. subdir2 contains a subdirectory subsubdir2, which contains a file file2.ext.

In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):


dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext


If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"". Note that the '\n' and '\t' are the new-line and tab characters.

Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s. Using the above example, the absolute path to file2.ext is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"". Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form name.extension, where name and extension consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

Wiggle Subsequence - A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

 * For example, [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5] is a wiggle sequence because the differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3) alternate between positive and negative.
 * In contrast, [1, 4, 7, 2, 5] and [1, 7, 4, 5, 5] are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]

    - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.

        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
    - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
        - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood] (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50

Dungeon Game - The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0.

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_statement.png]

The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

Custom Judge:

The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

 * intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
 * listA - The first linked list.
 * listB - The second linked list.
 * skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
 * skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.

 * void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
 * int top() gets the top element of the stack.
 * int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

 

Example 1:

The steps of the insertion sort algorithm:

 1. Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
 2. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.
 3. It repeats until no input elements remain.

The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

 

Example 1:


Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.


class Node {

    public List<Node> neighbors;
}


 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

 1. If the length of the string is 1, stop.
 2. If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
    * Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
    * Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
    * Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.

Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.
""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.

""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.

The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums.

Simplify Path - Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:

 * The path starts with a single slash '/'.
 * Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
 * The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
 * The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')

Text Justification - Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

Note:

 * A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
 * Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
 * The input array words contains at least one word.

 * For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

 * For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
 * Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
 * While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm] and use only constant extra memory.

Substring with Concatenation of All Words - You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.

A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

 * For example, if words = [""ab"",""cd"",""ef""], then ""abcdef"", ""abefcd"", ""cdabef"", ""cdefab"", ""efabcd"", and ""efcdab"" are all concatenated strings. ""acdbef"" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.

Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""barfoothefoobarman"", words = [""foo"",""bar""]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
The substring starting at 0 is ""barfoo"". It is the concatenation of [""bar"",""foo""] which is a permutation of words.
The substring starting at 9 is ""foobar"". It is the concatenation of [""foo"",""bar""] which is a permutation of words.
The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

 * I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
 * X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
 * C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

String to Integer (atoi) - Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

 1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
 2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
 3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
 4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. ""123"" -> 123, ""0032"" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
 5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
 6. Return the integer as the final result.

Note:

 * Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
 * Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.


Example 2:


Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.


Example 3:


Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)

Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
